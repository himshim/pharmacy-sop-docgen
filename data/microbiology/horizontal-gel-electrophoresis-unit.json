    "purpose": "To separate DNA or RNA fragments in a horizontal agarose gel format.",
    "scope": "Applicable to nucleic acid analysis in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Prepare agarose gel in buffer and pour into the casting tray with combs.",
      "After solidification, place the gel tray into the tank and add running buffer until the gel is submerged.",
      "Load DNA samples and ladder into wells using micropipettes.",
      "Place the lid on the tank and connect to the power supply.",
      "Run the gel at the recommended voltage until adequate separation is achieved.",
      "Turn OFF the power before removing the lid and gel.",
      "Stain or image the gel using appropriate methods.",
      "Discard used buffer and gels according to safety protocols."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always ensure correct electrode orientation; DNA migrates towards the anode.",
      "Do not touch the buffer when the power is ON.",
      "Handle ethidium bromide and other DNA stains with care.",
      "Avoid overheating by not exceeding recommended voltage.",
      "Check the tank for cracks or leaks before use."
