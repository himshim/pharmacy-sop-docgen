    "purpose": "To separate nucleic acids or proteins based on size and charge in an electric field.",
    "scope": "Applicable to molecular techniques in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Prepare the agarose or polyacrylamide gel and place it in the casting tray.",
      "Insert the comb to form wells and allow the gel to solidify.",
      "Place the gel in the electrophoresis tank and cover with running buffer.",
      "Carefully load samples and molecular weight markers into the wells.",
      "Place the lid on the tank and connect the electrodes to the power supply (anode/cathode correctly).",
      "Set the voltage and run time according to the protocol.",
      "Turn OFF the power supply before opening the tank.",
      "Remove the gel for staining or imaging.",
      "Dispose of used buffer and gels as per chemical/biological waste SOPs."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never touch the buffer or gel while the power is ON.",
      "Verify the correct polarity before starting the run.",
      "Ensure the tank is free from cracks and leaks.",
      "Handle staining agents like ethidium bromide with appropriate PPE.",
      "Do not exceed the recommended voltage to avoid overheating the gel."
