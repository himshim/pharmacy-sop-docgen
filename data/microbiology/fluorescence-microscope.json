    "purpose": "To visualize fluorescently labeled microorganisms or cellular structures.",
    "scope": "Applicable to advanced imaging in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the mercury/xenon lamp or LED light source and allow it to stabilize.",
      "Select the appropriate filter cube for the fluorophore used.",
      "Place the stained slide on the stage and focus using transmitted light first.",
      "Switch to fluorescence mode and fine-tune focus.",
      "Adjust exposure time and brightness to optimize signal while minimizing photobleaching.",
      "Capture images if a camera is attached.",
      "After use, turn OFF the fluorescence light source first, then the microscope.",
      "Cover the microscope to prevent dust accumulation."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid direct eye exposure to intense fluorescence light sources.",
      "Limit exposure time of samples to prevent photobleaching.",
      "Handle filter cubes carefully to avoid damage.",
      "Allow the mercury lamp to cool before switching it ON again if turned OFF.",
      "Dispose of mercury lamps according to hazardous waste regulations."
