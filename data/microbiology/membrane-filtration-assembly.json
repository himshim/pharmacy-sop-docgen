    "purpose": "To filter liquids through membrane filters for sterility testing and microbial enumeration.",
    "scope": "Applicable to microbiological quality control tests.",
    "procedure": [
      "Assemble the filtration unit and connect to a vacuum source.",
      "Place a sterile membrane filter onto the filter support using sterile forceps.",
      "Secure the funnel and pour the sample into it.",
      "Apply vacuum to draw the liquid through the membrane.",
      "Rinse the funnel with sterile diluent if required.",
      "Using sterile forceps, transfer the membrane onto the surface of an agar plate.",
      "Incubate the plate as per test requirements.",
      "Disassemble and disinfect the filtration unit after use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid touching the membrane surface with fingers.",
      "Ensure all parts in contact with sample are sterile.",
      "Check for leaks in the vacuum system before starting.",
      "Use appropriate membrane pore size for the microorganisms of interest.",
      "Dispose of membranes and waste as per biohazard SOPs."
