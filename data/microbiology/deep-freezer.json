    "purpose": "To store biological samples, media, and reagents at sub-zero temperatures for extended periods.",
    "scope": "Applicable to long-term storage activities in the Microbiology laboratory.",
    "procedure": [
      "Verify that the freezer temperature is set to the required value (e.g., -20°C or -80°C).",
      "Arrange samples in labeled boxes or racks to ensure easy identification.",
      "Place newly added samples away from the door to minimize temperature fluctuations.",
      "Monitor and record the internal temperature at least once daily.",
      "Defrost the freezer periodically if excessive ice buildup is observed.",
      "Clean the interior with a suitable disinfectant during defrost cycles.",
      "Ensure the door gasket is intact and seals properly.",
      "Maintain an updated inventory log of stored items."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overload the freezer as it may compromise cooling efficiency.",
      "Avoid prolonged door opening to prevent temperature rise.",
      "Wear insulated gloves when handling samples inside the freezer.",
      "Do not store explosive, volatile, or flammable chemicals unless the freezer is rated for such use.",
      "Ensure the freezer is connected to a backup power system if storing critical samples."
