    "purpose": "To observe specimens through binocular eyepieces while simultaneously capturing images via a camera port.",
    "scope": "Applicable to advanced imaging and teaching in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the microscope on a stable bench and connect power.",
      "Turn ON the light source and adjust brightness.",
      "Place the slide on the stage and focus using binocular eyepieces.",
      "Attach a compatible camera to the trinocular port if imaging is required.",
      "Adjust the light split between eyepieces and camera as needed.",
      "Capture images using the connected camera system.",
      "After use, turn OFF the light, remove the slide, and cover the microscope."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use only recommended cameras and adapters.",
      "Avoid touching optical surfaces with fingers.",
      "Do not use coarse focus at high magnification.",
      "Protect the instrument from dust and humidity.",
      "Disconnect power before any internal servicing."
