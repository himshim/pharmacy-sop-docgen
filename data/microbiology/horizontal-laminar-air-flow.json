  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To provide a unidirectional flow of HEPA-filtered air to protect samples from contamination during aseptic work.",
    "scope": "Applicable to aseptic dispensing and microbiological work in the laboratory.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the main power and blower of the laminar air flow unit.",
      "Allow the blower to run for at least 15–20 minutes before starting work.",
      "Wipe the work surface and interior walls with 70% ethanol.",
      "Place only essential sterile materials inside, arranging them to avoid blocking airflow.",
      "Perform all manipulations at least 6 inches inside from the front edge.",
      "Keep arm movements slow and minimize traffic around the cabinet.",
      "On completion, remove all materials after wiping external surfaces.",
      "Disinfect the work surface again with 70% ethanol.",
      "Run the blower for an additional 10 minutes before switching OFF."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not use open flames inside the laminar hood as they disturb airflow and may damage HEPA filters.",
      "Do not store materials permanently inside the hood.",
      "Ensure the front intake and rear exhaust grills are unobstructed.",
      "Replace or certify HEPA filters as per manufacturer guidelines.",
      "Use appropriate PPE even when working inside the hood."
