  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To provide a controlled temperature and oxygen-free atmosphere for the growth of anaerobes.",
    "scope": "Applicable to specialized microbial cultivation in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Verify the gas supply (typically a mix of N2, CO2, and H2).",
      "Power ON the incubator and set the required temperature and gas concentration.",
      "Purge the chamber with the anaerobic gas mixture to remove oxygen.",
      "Transfer samples into the chamber using the built-in transfer hatch (airlock).",
      "Monitor the atmospheric indicators (e.g., oxygen sensor or chemical strips) inside.",
      "Conduct routine checks on the catalyst (if present) to ensure effective oxygen removal.",
      "Maintain the water level in the humidity tray if required.",
      "Clean the interior shelves with a mild, non-corrosive disinfectant.",
      "Record the temperature and atmospheric status daily."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Strictly follow the airlock operation steps to prevent oxygen entry.",
      "Monitor gas tank pressure and replace tanks before they are empty.",
      "Ensure the catalyst is regenerated or replaced as per schedule.",
      "Report any persistent oxygen alerts or temperature deviations.",
      "Wear clean lab coats and gloves when accessing the chamber."
