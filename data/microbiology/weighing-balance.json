    "purpose": "To perform routine weighing of reagents and materials with general accuracy.",
    "scope": "Applicable to non-critical weighing tasks in the Microbiology laboratory.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the balance on a stable, level bench.",
      "Switch ON and ensure the display reads zero.",
      "Place a weighing paper or boat on the pan and tare the balance.",
      "Add material gradually to reach required weight.",
      "Record the reading and remove the load.",
      "Clean any spills and switch OFF the balance if not in continuous use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not weigh corrosive chemicals directly on the pan.",
      "Avoid overloading the balance.",
      "Keep the balance away from drafts and vibrations.",
      "Perform periodic accuracy checks with reference weights.",
      "Do not move the balance frequently once leveled."
