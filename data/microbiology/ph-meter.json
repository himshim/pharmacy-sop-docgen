  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To measure the pH of culture media, reagents, and water accurately.",
    "scope": "Applicable to routine pH measurements in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Turn ON the pH meter and allow it to warm up for 10–15 minutes.",
      "Rinse the electrode with distilled water and gently blot dry.",
      "Calibrate the instrument using at least two standard buffer solutions.",
      "Immerse the electrode in the sample solution and stir gently.",
      "Wait for the reading to stabilize and record the pH.",
      "Rinse the electrode between different samples.",
      "After use, store the electrode in appropriate storage solution.",
      "Document calibration and measurement details in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not touch or wipe the glass bulb aggressively.",
      "Never allow the electrode to dry out.",
      "Use fresh buffers for calibration.",
      "Avoid measuring very hot samples; allow them to cool to room temperature.",
      "Replace the electrode when response time or slope becomes unacceptable."
