    "purpose": "To visualize nucleic acids stained with fluorescent dyes in electrophoresis gels.",
    "scope": "Applicable to molecular microbiology applications.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the stained gel onto the transilluminator surface.",
      "Lower the protective UV shield or close the darkroom hood.",
      "Switch ON the UV light at the required wavelength.",
      "View or image the bands using appropriate protective equipment.",
      "After visualization, switch OFF the UV light.",
      "Remove the gel carefully and dispose of according to chemical/biological waste SOPs.",
      "Clean the glass surface with a suitable cleaner."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always wear UV-blocking face shield or goggles and gloves.",
      "Avoid prolonged UV exposure to minimize DNA damage and personal risk.",
      "Do not place sharp or abrasive objects on the glass surface.",
      "Handle staining dyes (e.g., ethidium bromide) as hazardous chemicals.",
      "Disconnect power before any servicing."
