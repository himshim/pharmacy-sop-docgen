    "purpose": "To preserve microbial cultures and cell lines at ultra-low temperatures using liquid nitrogen.",
    "scope": "Applicable to long-term preservation in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check the liquid nitrogen level in the Dewar flask regularly.",
      "Ensure all cryovials are labeled with moisture-resistant markers.",
      "Don necessary PPE including cryogenic gloves and a face shield.",
      "Use specialized tongs to retrieve or deposit samples in the racks.",
      "Ensure the lid is replaced securely to minimize nitrogen evaporation.",
      "Refill the liquid nitrogen as per the established schedule.",
      "Keep a detailed logbook of sample locations and quantities.",
      "Monitor the room for oxygen levels (use an O2 sensor).",
      "Ensure the storage area is well-ventilated."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid direct skin contact with liquid nitrogen to prevent severe frostbite.",
      "Never store the system in a confined space due to the risk of asphyxiation.",
      "Handle cryovials carefully as they may explode upon warming.",
      "Do not overfill the Dewar.",
      "Regularly inspect the Dewar for loss of vacuum (e.g., frost on the outer shell)."
