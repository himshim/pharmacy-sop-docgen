  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To visualize live, unstained cells and microorganisms using phase contrast optics.",
    "scope": "Applicable to advanced microscopic examination in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Turn ON the microscope light source and adjust brightness.",
      "Select a phase contrast objective and corresponding phase annulus on the condenser turret.",
      "Place the specimen slide on the stage.",
      "Focus on the specimen using low magnification first.",
      "Fine-tune the phase ring alignment using the phase telescope or centering screws.",
      "Switch to higher magnification as needed and adjust focus.",
      "After observation, lower the stage, remove the slide, and turn OFF the light.",
      "Cover the microscope to protect it from dust."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not use the coarse focus at high magnification.",
      "Keep the phase rings and condenser components clean.",
      "Avoid excessive light intensity to prevent specimen heating.",
      "Use only recommended cleaning materials for optical surfaces.",
      "Store objectives in a dry environment to prevent fungal growth."
