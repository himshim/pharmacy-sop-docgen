    "purpose": "To spread microbial inoculum evenly over agar surfaces using reusable glass spreaders.",
    "scope": "Applicable to plate count and isolation techniques in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Dip the glass spreader in 70% ethanol.",
      "Flame the spreader briefly to burn off the alcohol and achieve sterilization.",
      "Allow the spreader to cool near the flame without touching any surface.",
      "Dispense the inoculum onto the agar plate.",
      "Gently spread the inoculum over the surface using the cooled spreader.",
      "Return the spreader to the ethanol container after use.",
      "Autoclave spreaders periodically for thorough sterilization.",
      "Inspect glass spreaders for cracks and discard damaged ones."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not use excessive flaming that may cause glass breakage.",
      "Ensure the spreader is adequately cooled before touching the agar.",
      "Avoid flaming near flammable materials.",
      "Handle hot spreaders with care to prevent burns.",
      "Dispose of ethanol safely and keep containers closed when not in use."
