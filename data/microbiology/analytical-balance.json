    "purpose": "To provide high-precision weighing of media components and chemical reagents.",
    "scope": "Applicable to all quantitative tasks in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check the level of the balance and adjust if necessary.",
      "Power ON and allow 30 minutes for stabilization.",
      "Zero the balance and place a weighing boat on the pan.",
      "Tare the balance to ignore the boat's weight.",
      "Carefully add the sample and wait for the stability indicator.",
      "Record the weight and remove the sample.",
      "Clean the balance pan and surrounding area with a soft brush.",
      "Keep the draft shield closed when not loading samples.",
      "Switch OFF or leave in standby as per protocol."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not touch the weighing pan with bare hands.",
      "Protect the balance from drafts, vibrations, and heat.",
      "Always use weighing boats or paper; never weigh directly on the pan.",
      "Perform daily calibration checks with standard weights.",
      "Do not exceed the maximum capacity."
