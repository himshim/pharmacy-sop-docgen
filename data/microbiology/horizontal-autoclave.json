    "scope": "Applicable to centralized sterilization in the Microbiology facility.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check the boiler water level and fill if necessary with treated water.",
      "Load items onto the autoclave trolley, ensuring steam circulation gaps.",
      "Roll the trolley into the chamber and close the door securely.",
      "Select the sterilization program (e.g., 121°C for 30 minutes) on the controller.",
      "Start the cycle and monitor pressure, temperature, and time.",
      "Allow the cycle to complete, including drying phase if applicable.",
      "Confirm that pressure has returned to zero before opening the door.",
      "Open the door cautiously to vent steam and allow cooling.",
      "Unload materials using heat-resistant gloves and carts.",
      "Log the cycle parameters and any deviations."
