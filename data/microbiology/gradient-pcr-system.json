    "purpose": "To amplify DNA using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with a gradient of annealing temperatures.",
    "scope": "Applicable to molecular diagnostics and research in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the PCR thermal cycler and open the control software.",
      "Program the PCR cycling conditions, including denaturation, annealing, and extension steps.",
      "Set the gradient range for annealing temperature across the block.",
      "Prepare PCR reaction tubes or plates with master mix and template DNA on ice.",
      "Place the tubes in the thermal block, aligning them with the gradient positions.",
      "Close the heated lid and start the run.",
      "After completion, remove the tubes and store products at appropriate temperatures.",
      "Save or export the run log for documentation.",
      "Shut down the instrument as per manufacturer guidelines."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles of template DNA and reagents.",
      "Ensure tight sealing of tubes to prevent evaporation and contamination.",
      "Use aerosol-resistant tips during reaction setup.",
      "Do not open reaction tubes in the pre-PCR setup area.",
      "Regularly calibrate the block temperature and heated lid."
