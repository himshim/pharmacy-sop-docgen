    "purpose": "To measure absorbance in microplates for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).",
    "scope": "Applicable to serological and immunological testing in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the ELISA reader and allow it to warm up.",
      "Open the control software and select the appropriate assay protocol.",
      "Insert the microplate into the carrier tray in the correct orientation.",
      "Close the tray and start the reading sequence.",
      "Wait for the instrument to measure absorbance at specified wavelengths.",
      "Review the raw data and export results for analysis.",
      "Remove the plate and dispose of it as biohazard waste if applicable.",
      "Shut down the software and power OFF the instrument."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure there are no bubbles in the wells before reading.",
      "Avoid spilling reagents on the plate surface or reader tray.",
      "Regularly clean the optical path and plate holder as per SOP.",
      "Verify wavelength calibration periodically.",
      "Handle plates containing infectious material in a biosafety cabinet before and after reading."
