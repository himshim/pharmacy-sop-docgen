    "purpose": "To separate proteins or nucleic acids in vertical slab gels.",
    "scope": "Applicable to SDS-PAGE and related techniques in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Assemble the glass plates and spacers to cast the polyacrylamide gel.",
      "Pour resolving and stacking gels as per protocol and insert combs.",
      "After polymerization, remove the comb and mount the gel assembly in the tank.",
      "Fill the inner and outer chambers with running buffer.",
      "Load samples and molecular weight markers into wells.",
      "Connect the tank to the power supply and set appropriate voltage.",
      "Run the gel until the dye front reaches the desired position.",
      "Turn OFF the power, disassemble the gel, and proceed with staining or blotting.",
      "Dispose of buffers and gels according to safety procedures."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure correct assembly to prevent leakage.",
      "Handle acrylamide solutions with care as they are neurotoxic.",
      "Do not touch the buffer or gel while power is ON.",
      "Avoid excessive voltage that may overheat and distort bands.",
      "Use appropriate PPE when handling stains and destaining solutions."
