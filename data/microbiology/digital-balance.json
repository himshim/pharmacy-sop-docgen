    "purpose": "To perform general-purpose weighing of chemicals and media components with moderate precision.",
    "scope": "Applicable to routine weighing tasks in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the balance on a stable, vibration-free surface.",
      "Switch ON the instrument and allow it to initialize.",
      "Check and adjust the level using the leveling feet and spirit bubble.",
      "Place a clean weighing container on the pan and press 'TARE'.",
      "Add the material to be weighed until the desired mass is obtained.",
      "Record the reading once it stabilizes.",
      "Remove the container and wipe any spills from the pan.",
      "Switch OFF the balance after use if required by SOP."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not exceed the maximum capacity of the balance.",
      "Avoid drafts, direct sunlight, and heat sources near the balance.",
      "Never place chemicals directly onto the weighing pan.",
      "Calibrate the balance periodically using certified weights.",
      "Keep the balance clean and covered when not in use."
