    "purpose": "To count microbial colonies on Petri dishes with electronic tallying.",
    "scope": "Applicable to microbial enumeration in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the digital colony counter and adjust the illumination.",
      "Place the agar plate centrally on the counting surface.",
      "Focus the magnifier or digital display for clear visualization of colonies.",
      "Use the stylus or touch pen to mark each colony, ensuring the counter registers each touch.",
      "Verify the count by scanning the entire plate systematically.",
      "Record the final colony count displayed.",
      "Reset the counter to zero before proceeding to the next plate.",
      "Clean the surface and stylus with disinfectant regularly."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid excessive pressure on the plate to prevent cracking.",
      "Ensure the plate backside is free from condensation or markings that may interfere with counting.",
      "Check counter sensitivity periodically.",
      "Do not expose the device to spills or corrosive chemicals.",
      "Use appropriate eye protection if viewing under strong illumination for prolonged periods."
