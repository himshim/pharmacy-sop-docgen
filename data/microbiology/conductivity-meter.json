    "purpose": "To measure the electrolytic conductivity of water and media solutions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to water quality checks and media prep in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Power ON the meter and check the probe connection.",
      "Calibrate the meter with a standard solution of known conductivity.",
      "Rinse the probe with distilled water and dry gently.",
      "Immerse the probe in the sample solution.",
      "Wait for the stability indicator and record the reading.",
      "Rinse the probe thoroughly after each measurement.",
      "Store the probe in the storage solution recommended by the manufacturer.",
      "Document the measurement results and calibration data."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure there are no air bubbles trapped in the probe sensing area.",
      "Do not use the probe in solutions that may damage the platinum coating.",
      "Perform calibration daily or before each set of measurements.",
      "Handle the probe with care to avoid mechanical shock.",
      "Rinse between different samples to prevent carryover contamination."
