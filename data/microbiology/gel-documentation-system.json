    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the transilluminator and camera system.",
      "Place the stained gel on the transilluminator surface.",
      "Close the darkroom hood or door to prevent light interference.",
      "Adjust focus, zoom, and exposure using the control software.",
      "Capture the image and save with an appropriate file name.",
      "Turn OFF the UV light when not actively imaging.",
