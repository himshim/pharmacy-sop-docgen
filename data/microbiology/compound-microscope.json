      "Place the microscope on a stable bench and connect to power.",
      "Adjust the light intensity and open the condenser diaphragm.",
      "Mount the slide and center the specimen under the 10x objective.",
      "Use coarse focus to find the image and fine focus to sharpen it.",
      "Switch to 40x for more detail, using only the fine adjustment.",
      "For 100x, add a drop of immersion oil and slowly raise the stage until the lens touches the oil.",
      "Wipe the oil off the lens and slide immediately after use.",
      "Turn the light to the lowest setting before switching OFF.",
      "Store in a clean, dry place with the dust cover."
