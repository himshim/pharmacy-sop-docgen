    "purpose": "To determine the pH of media, buffers, and water samples accurately.",
    "scope": "Applicable to pH measurement tasks in the Microbiology laboratory.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the pH meter and allow it to stabilize for 10-15 minutes.",
      "Rinse the pH electrode with distilled water and blot dry with tissue.",
      "Calibrate the meter using at least two standard buffer solutions (e.g., pH 4.0 and 7.0).",
      "Immerse the electrode in the sample solution and stir gently.",
      "Wait until the reading stabilizes and record the pH and temperature.",
      "Rinse the electrode thoroughly between different samples.",
      "After use, store the electrode in the recommended storage solution.",
      "Document calibration data and sample readings in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never store the pH electrode in distilled water.",
      "Avoid touching the glass bulb of the electrode.",
      "Use fresh buffer solutions for accurate calibration.",
      "Do not use the electrode in viscous or strongly oxidizing solutions without checking compatibility.",
      "Replace the electrode if response time becomes excessively slow."
