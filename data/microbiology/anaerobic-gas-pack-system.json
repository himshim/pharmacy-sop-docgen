    "purpose": "To create an oxygen-free environment for the cultivation of anaerobic microorganisms.",
    "scope": "Applicable to anaerobic culture techniques in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the inoculated culture plates into an anaerobic jar.",
      "Open the anaerobic gas generator envelope according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
      "Place the envelope into the jar along with a redox indicator strip (e.g., Resazurin or Methylene Blue).",
      "Immediately seal the lid of the jar tightly.",
      "Observe the indicator strip; a change in color indicates that anaerobic conditions are being established.",
      "Incubate the jar at the required temperature.",
      "After incubation, carefully open the jar in a ventilated area.",
      "Check the indicator again to ensure anaerobic conditions were maintained throughout.",
      "Discard the used gas pack according to hazardous waste protocols."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not use expired gas packs or indicators.",
      "Ensure the jar gasket is clean and properly lubricated for an airtight seal.",
      "Be cautious of heat generation by the chemical reaction in some gas pack types.",
      "Avoid breathing in the gas mixture when opening the jar.",
      "Perform a leak test on the jar periodically."
