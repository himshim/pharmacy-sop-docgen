    "purpose": "To automatically wash microplate wells during ELISA procedures.",
    "scope": "Applicable to immunoassay workflows in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fill the wash buffer reservoir with the appropriate solution.",
      "Prime the system by running a few wash cycles without a plate.",
      "Place the microplate on the washer platform and secure it.",
      "Program the number of wash cycles, volume, and soak time as per assay protocol.",
      "Start the wash cycle and observe at least the first pass.",
      "After washing, remove the plate and gently tap it on absorbent paper to remove residual liquid.",
      "Run a rinse cycle with distilled water at the end of use.",
      "Empty and clean the waste bottle and tubing."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure that the aspiration needles are correctly aligned to avoid scratching wells.",
      "Use only recommended wash buffers to prevent precipitation.",
      "Do not allow wash buffer or waste containers to run dry or overflow.",
      "Regularly check and clean filters and tubing.",
      "Disconnect power before performing any internal maintenance."
