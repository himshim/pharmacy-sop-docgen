    "purpose": "To provide a localized flame for heat-sterilizing small tools like inoculating loops.",
    "scope": "Applicable to aseptic techniques in the Microbiology laboratory.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check the fuel level (typically 70-95% ethanol) and the condition of the wick.",
      "Ensure the burner is placed on a stable, heat-resistant surface away from flammable items.",
      "Trim the wick if it is charred to ensure a steady flame.",
      "Light the wick using a safety lighter or match.",
      "Adjust the wick height if necessary to achieve the desired flame size.",
      "Hold the tool (e.g., loop) in the hottest part of the flame until it glows red.",
      "Extinguish the flame by placing the cap or snuffer over the wick.",
      "Allow the burner to cool before refilling or storing.",
