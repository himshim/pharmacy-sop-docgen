  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To generate and maintain anaerobic conditions using evacuation and gas replacement.",
    "scope": "Applicable to strict anaerobe culture in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Load inoculated plates into the jar and secure the lid.",
      "Connect the jar to a vacuum pump and evacuate air to the recommended pressure.",
      "Introduce hydrogen and CO2 gas mixture through the inlet valve.",
      "Place a catalyst (e.g., palladium pellets) and indicator strip inside the jar.",
      "Seal the valves and incubate at the required temperature.",
      "After incubation, release pressure slowly and open the lid.",
      "Verify that the indicator confirms anaerobic conditions were maintained."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure all valves and seals are in good condition before use.",
      "Avoid rapid decompression to prevent disturbance of plates.",
      "Handle gas cylinders according to safety regulations.",
      "Regenerate or replace catalyst as required.",
      "Check for leaks periodically using approved methods."
