  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To amplify DNA using programmed thermal cycling conditions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to molecular diagnostics and research in the Microbiology laboratory.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the thermal cycler and open the control software or front panel interface.",
      "Program the denaturation, annealing, and extension temperatures and times as per the PCR protocol.",
      "Prepare PCR reaction tubes or plates with master mix, primers, template DNA, and nuclease-free water.",
      "Briefly spin down the tubes to collect contents at the bottom.",
      "Place the tubes/plate into the thermal block ensuring good contact.",
      "Close the heated lid and start the PCR run.",
      "After completion, remove the tubes and store the amplified products at 2–8°C or -20°C as required.",
      "Save or print the run report for documentation.",
      "Shut down the instrument as per manufacturer instructions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Set up PCR reactions in a separate clean area to avoid contamination.",
      "Use aerosol-resistant filter tips for pipetting.",
      "Ensure tubes are sealed properly to prevent evaporation.",
      "Avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles of DNA and reagents.",
      "Periodically verify block temperature accuracy and lid pressure."
