    "procedure": [
      "Place the microscope on a flat surface and plug into a power source.",
      "Switch ON the light source and adjust the intensity.",
      "Place the slide on the stage and secure with the specimen holder.",
      "Start with the lowest power objective (4x or 10x).",
      "Adjust the interpupillary distance and diopter settings for your eyes.",
      "Use the coarse and fine adjustment knobs to focus the image.",
      "Rotate the nosepiece to higher power objectives as needed.",
      "Apply immersion oil only for the 100x objective.",
