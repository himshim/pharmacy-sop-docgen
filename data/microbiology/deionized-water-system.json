    "purpose": "To produce deionized water for media preparation, reagent dilution, and equipment cleaning.",
    "scope": "Applicable to water purification activities in the Microbiology laboratory.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check the inlet water supply and ensure valves are open.",
      "Switch ON the deionization unit as per manufacturer instructions.",
      "Allow water to run for a few minutes to flush the system.",
      "Collect deionized water in clean, labeled glass or plastic containers.",
      "Measure and periodically record the conductivity or resistivity of the output water.",
      "Replace resin cartridges or filters when water quality deteriorates beyond set limits.",
      "Sanitize the storage tank at defined intervals.",
      "Turn OFF the system if it will not be used for an extended period."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not touch the inner surfaces of collection containers.",
      "Ensure regular monitoring to prevent microbial growth in the storage tank.",
      "Use only approved cartridges and filters.",
      "Protect the system from freezing temperatures.",
      "Follow lockout/tagout procedures during maintenance."
