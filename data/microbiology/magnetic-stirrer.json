    "purpose": "To mix liquid media or reagents using a magnetic stir bar.",
    "scope": "Applicable to solution preparation in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the stirrer on a level surface.",
      "Add a clean magnetic stir bar to the container with liquid.",
      "Place the container centrally on the stirrer platform.",
      "Switch ON and gradually increase the stirring speed.",
      "Adjust to obtain a stable vortex without splashing.",
      "After mixing, reduce speed to zero and switch OFF.",
      "Retrieve the stir bar using a magnetic retriever."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not operate at excessively high speeds causing decoupling.",
      "Keep liquids away from electrical controls.",
      "Ensure the stir bar is compatible with chemicals used.",
      "Do not use for very viscous solutions.",
      "Clean the platform after spills."
