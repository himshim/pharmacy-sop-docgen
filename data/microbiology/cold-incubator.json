    "purpose": "To provide low-temperature incubation (below ambient) for the growth of psychrophilic organisms.",
    "scope": "Applicable to environmental microbiology studies.",
    "procedure": [
      "Verify the unit is clean and the shelves are properly positioned.",
      "Power ON and set the required low temperature (e.g., 10°C or 15°C).",
      "Allow the incubator to reach the set temperature and stabilize.",
      "Place the samples in the chamber.",
      "Monitor and record the temperature daily.",
      "Check for ice buildup on the cooling coils and defrost if necessary.",
      "Clean the interior surfaces periodically with an appropriate disinfectant.",
      "Document any temperature fluctuations in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overload the chamber, as it prevents proper air circulation.",
      "Ensure the door seal is tight to prevent moisture condensation.",
      "Do not store items that could release corrosive vapors.",
      "Report any unusual noises from the compressor unit.",
      "Ensure the drainage system for defrosting is clear."
