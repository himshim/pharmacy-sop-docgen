    "purpose": "To store microbial cultures, reagents, and samples at ultra-low temperatures (typically -70°C to -86°C).",
    "scope": "Applicable to long-term biological sample preservation in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check that the set temperature is within the required ultra-low range.",
      "Organize samples in labeled cryoboxes and racks for easy retrieval.",
      "Limit door opening time to reduce temperature fluctuations.",
      "Monitor and log the internal temperature daily.",
      "Inspect door gaskets and remove frost buildup as needed.",
      "Connect the alarm system and backup power where available.",
      "Schedule periodic maintenance as recommended by the manufacturer."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Wear insulated gloves and face protection when accessing the freezer.",
      "Do not use sharp tools to remove ice.",
      "Avoid overloading the freezer.",
      "Ensure adequate room ventilation to dissipate compressor heat.",
      "Plan for emergency response in case of freezer failure."
