    "purpose": "To gently warm slides during staining or mounting procedures.",
    "scope": "Applicable to histological and microbiological slide preparation.",
    "procedure": [
      "Turn ON the slide warmer and set the temperature (typically 37–60°C).",
      "Allow the surface to reach and stabilize at the set temperature.",
      "Place slides flat on the warming surface.",
      "Monitor the slides periodically to avoid overdrying.",
      "After use, remove slides and switch OFF the unit.",
      "Wipe the surface with a soft cloth once cooled."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not place plastic items that may melt on the warmer.",
      "Avoid temperatures high enough to distort slides or media.",
      "Keep liquids from spilling onto electrical parts.",
      "Use heat-resistant gloves if handling very warm slides.",
      "Place the warmer away from flammable materials."
