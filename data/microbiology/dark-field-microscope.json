  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To visualize live, unstained microorganisms by reflecting light off the specimen against a dark background.",
    "scope": "Applicable to specialized microscopic analysis in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Set up the microscope on a stable surface and power ON.",
      "Install the dark-field condenser and center it properly.",
      "Place the slide on the stage and ensure it is clean.",
      "Focus the specimen using a low-power objective first.",
      "Adjust the condenser height to achieve a completely dark field with a bright specimen.",
      "Switch to higher power objectives if necessary.",
      "After observation, remove the slide and clean the lenses.",
      "Turn OFF the light and store the instrument properly.",
      "Replace the dark-field condenser with a bright-field one if needed for other work."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "The specimen and slide must be extremely clean; dust scatter light.",
      "Avoid using very thick slides or specimens.",
      "The light source must be very bright for effective dark-field visualization.",
      "Handle the specialized condenser with care.",
      "Do not use coarse focus with high-power objectives."
