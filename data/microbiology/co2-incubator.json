  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To provide a controlled temperature, humidity, and CO2 level for cell and tissue cultures.",
    "scope": "Applicable to advanced microbial and cell studies in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the CO2 cylinder is connected and has sufficient pressure.",
      "Power ON and set the required temperature, CO2 concentration (e.g., 5%), and humidity.",
      "Fill the water pan with sterile distilled water to maintain humidity.",
      "Allow the incubator to stabilize (typically several hours).",
      "Load samples onto the shelves, avoiding overcrowding.",
      "Monitor and record the temperature and CO2 levels daily.",
      "Check the water level in the pan every 2 days.",
      "Clean the interior shelves and door gaskets with a mild disinfectant regularly.",
      "Conduct a decontamination cycle (if equipped) as per the maintenance plan."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not open the door frequently, as CO2 levels drop rapidly.",
      "Ensure the incubator is placed on a level surface away from vibrations.",
      "Monitor the CO2 tank pressure and change tanks before they are empty.",
      "Use only sterile distilled water in the humidity pan to prevent contamination.",
      "Calibrate the CO2 sensor and thermometer annually."
