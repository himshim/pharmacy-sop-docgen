    "procedure": [
      "Place the centrifuge on a level, stable laboratory bench.",
      "Inspect the rotor for any visible damage or debris.",
      "Fill tubes equally and balance them by weight before loading.",
      "Insert tubes symmetrically into the rotor holders.",
      "Close the lid securely and set the speed and time.",
      "Start the run and stay nearby until it reaches operating speed.",
      "If abnormal vibration occurs, stop the unit immediately.",
      "Wait for the rotor to stop completely before opening the lid.",
      "Remove tubes and wipe the interior with a disinfectant.",
      "Document the centrifuge run in the equipment logbook."

    "precautions": [
      "Never operate the centrifuge with an unbalanced rotor.",
      "Ensure all tubes are tightly capped to prevent aerosol formation.",
      "Do not attempt to stop the rotor with your hands.",
      "Use only tubes rated for the maximum speed setting.",
      "Clean any spills immediately to prevent corrosion."
