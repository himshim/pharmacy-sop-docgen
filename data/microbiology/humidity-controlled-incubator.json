    "purpose": "To incubate cultures at controlled temperature and relative humidity.",
    "scope": "Applicable to fungal and special microbial culture conditions in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fill the humidity tray with distilled water.",
      "Set the desired temperature and relative humidity on the controller.",
      "Allow the incubator to stabilize at set conditions.",
      "Load inoculated plates or culture vessels on the shelves.",
      "Close the door properly and minimize door openings.",
      "Check and record temperature and humidity at least once daily.",
      "Refill the water tray and clean it periodically to prevent fungal growth.",
      "After use, remove cultures and disinfect interior surfaces."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use only distilled or deionized water to avoid scale formation.",
      "Do not overload shelves as this restricts airflow.",
      "Immediately report large deviations from set conditions.",
      "Clean spills promptly to prevent contamination.",
      "Ensure proper calibration of temperature and humidity sensors."
