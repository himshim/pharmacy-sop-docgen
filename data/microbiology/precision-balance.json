    "purpose": "To weigh media components and reagents with precision to the nearest milligram or centigram.",
    "scope": "Applicable to routine weighing tasks in the Microbiology laboratory.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the balance is level and the weighing pan is clean.",
      "Power ON the instrument and wait for the display to stabilize at zero.",
      "Place a weighing container on the pan and press the 'TARE' key.",
      "Add the substance slowly until the desired mass is reached.",
      "Record the stable reading displayed.",
      "Remove the container and gently brush off any spilled material.",
      "Switch OFF or leave on standby as per laboratory procedure."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not exceed the maximum weighing capacity.",
      "Protect the balance from drafts and vibrations.",
      "Avoid direct contact of chemicals with the pan.",
      "Perform routine calibration checks using standard weights.",
      "Keep the balance covered when not in use."
