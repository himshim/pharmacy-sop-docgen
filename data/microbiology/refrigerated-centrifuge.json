    "purpose": "To centrifuge temperature-sensitive samples at controlled low temperatures.",
    "scope": "Applicable to processing of microbial and molecular biology samples.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the centrifuge and set the desired temperature for pre-cooling.",
      "Balance the sample tubes by weight and place them symmetrically in the rotor.",
      "Secure the rotor lid and close the main centrifuge lid.",
      "Set the required speed (RPM/RCF) and time.",
      "Start the run and monitor for abnormal noise or vibration.",
      "After completion, wait until the rotor stops completely before opening the lid.",
      "Remove the samples promptly and wipe any condensation in the chamber.",
      "Leave the lid slightly open after use to prevent condensation and odor."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never operate with unbalanced tubes.",
      "Do not exceed the maximum rated speed for the rotor.",
      "Check tubes and caps for cracks before use.",
      "Clean spilled samples immediately with appropriate disinfectant.",
      "Perform periodic maintenance and rotor inspection as per SOP."
