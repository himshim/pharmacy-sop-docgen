    "scope": "Applicable to routine inoculation procedures in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Hold the inoculating loop like a pen in the dominant hand.",
      "Sterilize the loop by placing it in the hottest part of a flame until red hot.",
      "Allow the loop to cool near the flame without touching any surface.",
      "Touch the cooled loop to the culture to pick up a small inoculum.",
      "Streak or inoculate the target medium as per the required pattern.",
      "Re-sterilize the loop after completing the transfer.",
      "Store the sterile loop in a suitable stand when not in use."

    "precautions": [
      "Ensure adequate cooling to avoid killing microorganisms and splattering.",
      "Avoid creating aerosols while flaming.",
      "Take care to prevent accidental burns.",
      "Do not place hot loops on the bench.",
      "Inspect loops regularly and discard if bent or damaged."
