    "purpose": "To spin small-volume microtubes for rapid pelleting of cells or nucleic acids.",
    "scope": "Applicable to molecular and microbiological sample preparation.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the micro centrifuge on a stable, level surface.",
      "Load microtubes in opposite slots to balance the rotor.",
      "Close the lid securely.",
      "Set the required speed (RPM) and time.",
      "Start the centrifuge and wait for it to reach full speed.",
      "After completion, wait until the rotor stops before opening the lid.",
      "Carefully remove tubes to avoid mixing the pellet."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not open the lid while the rotor is spinning.",
      "Always balance tubes by weight and volume.",
      "Use tubes rated for the maximum speed.",
      "Clean any spills immediately with appropriate disinfectant.",
      "Do not exceed the manufacturer’s recommended RPM."
