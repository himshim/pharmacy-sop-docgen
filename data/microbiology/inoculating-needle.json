    "purpose": "To transfer microbial cultures, particularly for stab and streak inoculations.",
    "scope": "Applicable to routine microbiological culture techniques.",
    "procedure": [
      "Hold the inoculating needle in the dominant hand like a pen.",
      "Sterilize the needle by heating in a Bunsen or alcohol burner flame until red hot.",
      "Allow the needle to cool near the flame without touching any surface.",
      "Pick a small amount of culture from the source medium.",
      "Inoculate the target medium using the required technique (stab, streak, etc.).",
      "Re-flame the needle after inoculation.",
      "Place the sterile needle in a suitable stand when not in use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure complete cooling before touching culture to avoid killing microorganisms.",
      "Do not wave the hot needle in the air, which can create aerosols.",
      "Avoid excessive force that may gouge agar surfaces.",
      "Handle with care to prevent needle-stick injuries.",
      "Store needles in a dry, clean container when not in use."
