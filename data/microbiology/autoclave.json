    "purpose": "To sterilize laboratory media, glassware, and waste using pressurized steam.",
    "scope": "Applicable to sterilization and decontamination in Microbiology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check the water level in the reservoir and top up with distilled water if needed.",
      "Load materials into the chamber, ensuring they are not tightly packed.",
      "Ensure bottle caps are loose to prevent pressure buildup and breakage.",
      "Close the door and lock the safety handle.",
      "Set the sterilization cycle (standard: 121°C at 15 psi for 15-20 minutes).",
      "Start the cycle and monitor the pressure and temperature gauges.",
      "Once the cycle is complete, wait for the pressure to drop to zero.",
      "Slowly open the door while wearing heat-resistant gloves.",
      "Allow items to cool before removal.",
      "Record the cycle details in the sterilization log."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never open the autoclave until the pressure is fully released.",
      "Wear heat-resistant gloves and a face shield when unloading.",
      "Do not sterilize sealed containers or flammable liquids.",
      "Ensure the drain valve and safety valve are functional.",
      "Perform periodic validation using biological indicators (e.g., Geobacillus stearothermophilus)."
