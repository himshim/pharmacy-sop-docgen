    "purpose": "To measure the acidity or alkalinity of liquid pharmaceutical samples.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical tasks in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the pH meter and allow 10-15 minutes for stabilization.",
      "Rinse the pH electrode with distilled water and blot dry.",
      "Perform a two-point calibration with pH 4.0 and 7.0 buffer solutions.",
      "Immerse the electrode in the sample and wait for a stable reading.",
      "Record the pH value and temperature.",
      "Rinse the electrode thoroughly with distilled water after measurement.",
      "Keep the electrode bulb submerged in storage solution when not in use.",
      "Document calibration and results in the equipment logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never let the electrode bulb dry out.",
      "Avoid touching the sensitive glass bulb with fingers.",
      "Use fresh buffer solutions for every calibration.",
      "Handle the electrode gently to avoid breakage.",
      "Allow samples to reach room temperature for accurate results."
