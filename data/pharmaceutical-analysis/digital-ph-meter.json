    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the measurement of pH with digital precision.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical testing in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the pH meter and allow it to warm up for 15 minutes.",
      "Rinse the pH electrode with distilled water and blot dry.",
      "Perform a two-point calibration using pH 4.0 and 7.0 (or 10.0) buffers.",
      "Immerse the electrode in the sample solution and stir gently.",
      "Record the pH value once the display shows a stable reading.",
      "Rinse the electrode thoroughly after each use.",
      "Store the electrode in 3M KCl or the recommended storage solution.",
      "Document the calibration and results in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never let the pH electrode dry out.",
      "Avoid touching the glass bulb with bare fingers.",
      "Calibrate the instrument at the beginning of each day.",
      "Use fresh buffer solutions for calibration.",
      "Rinse the electrode between different samples to prevent contamination."
