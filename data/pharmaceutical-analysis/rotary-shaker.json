    "purpose": "To provide gentle to vigorous rotational mixing for extraction and solubility studies.",
    "scope": "Applicable to laboratory mixing in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the sample flasks securely in the holders on the platform.",
      "Ensure the load is balanced to prevent motor strain.",
      "Set the rotation speed and duration on the control panel.",
      "Switch ON the unit and monitor the initial motion.",
      "Once the cycle is complete, turn OFF and remove the flasks.",
      "Clean the platform and clips after each use.",
      "Document the shaking speed and duration used."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overload the platform beyond its weight limits.",
      "Ensure all containers are tightly capped to avoid spills.",
      "Check that the clips are holding the flasks firmly.",
      "Avoid high-speed operation for large or top-heavy containers.",
      "Report any unusual motor noise to the maintenance team."
