    "purpose": "To accurately weigh chemical substances and pharmaceutical samples.",
    "scope": "Applicable to laboratory weighing in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the balance is level and the weighing pan is clean.",
      "Power ON the unit and wait for the stabilization signal.",
      "Place a weighing boat on the pan and press the 'TARE' button.",
      "Add the material slowly until the required weight is achieved.",
      "Record the weight reading once the stability indicator is displayed.",
      "Remove the sample and clean the pan with a soft brush.",
      "Switch OFF the balance at the end of the shift."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid placing the balance near air vents or heat sources.",
      "Do not exceed the maximum load capacity of the balance.",
      "Use tweezers or spatulas to add samples; never use hands.",
      "Verify the balance calibration daily using standard weights.",
      "Keep the draft shield closed during the weighing process."
