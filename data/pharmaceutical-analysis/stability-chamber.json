    "purpose": "To provide controlled environmental conditions for drug stability studies.",
    "scope": "Applicable to stability testing in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Set the required temperature and humidity on the controller.",
      "Allow the chamber to reach set points and stabilize.",
      "Load samples in specified containers ensuring space for airflow.",
      "Record the temperature and humidity daily from the display.",
      "Conduct periodic inspections for water levels and sensor function.",
      "Retrieve samples at scheduled time points for analysis.",
      "Document any deviations or alarm conditions immediately.",
      "Perform annual calibration of all sensors."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overload the chamber, as it inhibits air circulation.",
      "Minimize door opening time to prevent fluctuations.",
      "Use only purified water for the humidification system.",
      "Ensure a backup power supply for critical long-term studies.",
      "Check and clean the interior shelves periodically."
