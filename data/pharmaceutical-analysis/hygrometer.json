    "purpose": "To measure the relative humidity of the laboratory environment.",
    "scope": "Applicable to environmental monitoring in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the hygrometer in a location away from direct air currents.",
      "Allow 15-30 minutes for the sensor to stabilize.",
      "Read the relative humidity percentage from the display/scale.",
      "Record the humidity and temperature in the daily logbook.",
      "Check for maximum and minimum values if the device has memory.",
      "Reset the device daily after recording observations.",
      "Keep the sensor area clean and free from dust."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not touch the internal sensor elements.",
      "Avoid placing near humidifiers or air conditioning vents.",
      "Replace batteries promptly when the low-power indicator appears.",
      "Verify accuracy against a reference standard annually.",
      "Avoid exposure to corrosive chemical vapors."
