    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for measuring the absorbance of colored solutions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical tasks in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the colorimeter and allow it to warm up for 15 minutes.",
      "Select the appropriate filter or wavelength for the sample being analyzed.",
      "Fill a clean cuvette with the blank (solvent) and wipe the sides with a lint-free tissue.",
      "Insert the blank into the sample holder and set the instrument to zero absorbance.",
      "Replace the blank with the sample solution in a similar cuvette.",
      "Record the absorbance or transmittance value from the display.",
      "Repeat the measurement for standards to create a calibration curve.",
      "Clean the cuvettes and the sample compartment after use.",
      "Switch OFF the instrument at the end of the day."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always handle cuvettes by the frosted sides to avoid fingerprints.",
      "Ensure there are no air bubbles in the sample solution.",
      "Use matched cuvettes for more accurate results.",
      "Maintain a consistent orientation of the cuvette in the holder.",
      "Protect the instrument from dust and chemical vapors."
