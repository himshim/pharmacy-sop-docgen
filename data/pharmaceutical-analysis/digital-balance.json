    "procedure": [
      "Place the balance on a level, stable surface.",
      "Turn ON the balance and wait for the zero reading to stabilize.",
      "Level the balance using the leveling feet and spirit level.",
      "Place the weighing boat or paper on the pan and press 'TARE'.",
      "Add the sample until the target weight is reached.",
      "Record the weight once the stability icon appears.",
      "Clean the pan and the surrounding area with a soft brush after use.",
      "Switch OFF the balance at the end of the day."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not place chemicals directly on the weighing pan.",
      "Ensure the balance is protected from drafts and vibrations.",
      "Do not exceed the maximum capacity of the balance.",
      "Calibrate the balance periodically with standard weights.",
      "Avoid placing the balance near sources of heat or humidity."
