    "purpose": "To measure the temperature of liquids and ambient air.",
    "scope": "Applicable to general laboratory testing in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Inspect the thermometer for cracks or breaks in the liquid column.",
      "Immerse the bulb into the center of the liquid/medium.",
      "Wait for the reading to stabilize before recording.",
      "Read the temperature at eye level to avoid parallax error.",
      "Clean the thermometer with distilled water after each use.",
      "Dry with a soft tissue and store in its protective sleeve.",
      "Verify accuracy against a reference thermometer annually."

      "Do not use the thermometer as a stirring rod.",
      "Avoid sudden temperature shocks which can break the glass.",
      "Dispose of broken thermometers as hazardous waste.",
      "Store vertically or at an angle to prevent separation of the liquid.",
