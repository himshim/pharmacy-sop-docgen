    "purpose": "To measure the refractive index of liquids for identification and purity checks.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical testing in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Clean the prism surface with alcohol and a soft tissue.",
      "Place a few drops of the sample on the prism and close the cover.",
      "Adjust the light and view through the eyepiece to find the boundary line.",
      "Align the crosshairs with the boundary and read the refractive index.",
      "Record the temperature at which the measurement was taken.",
      "Clean the prism immediately after use with distilled water and dry.",
      "Calibrate the instrument regularly using distilled water."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "The prism surface is delicate; do not use abrasive cleaning tools.",
      "Ensure the liquid covers the entire prism surface without bubbles.",
      "Always check the temperature, as RI is temperature-dependent.",
      "Do not use the refractometer for corrosive or etching liquids.",
      "Store the instrument in a dust-free environment."
