    "purpose": "To provide controlled humidity and temperature conditions for stability testing.",
    "scope": "Applicable to storage and stability activities in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the water reservoir is filled with purified water.",
      "Set the required temperature and humidity (e.g., 25°C / 60% RH).",
      "Allow the chamber to reach set points and stabilize.",
      "Place samples in the chamber ensuring proper spacing for air circulation.",
      "Monitor the display daily and record temperature/humidity values.",
      "Check water levels periodically and top up as needed.",
      "Conduct scheduled inspections for any alarm conditions.",
      "Record all maintenance and calibration activities."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use only distilled or deionized water to prevent scale build-up.",
      "Minimize the frequency and duration of door openings.",
      "Do not overload the chamber beyond its capacity.",
      "Report any deviations from set storage conditions immediately.",
      "Ensure periodic calibration of sensors."
