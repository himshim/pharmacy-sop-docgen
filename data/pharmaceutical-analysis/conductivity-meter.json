    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the direct measurement of electrolytic conductivity.",
    "scope": "Applicable to quantitative analysis in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Power ON the conductivity meter and check the probe connection.",
      "Calibrate the meter using a standard solution (e.g., 0.01M KCl).",
      "Rinse the probe with deionized water and blot dry.",
      "Place the probe into the sample solution and wait for the reading to stabilize.",
      "Record the conductivity and temperature displayed on the screen.",
      "Rinse the probe thoroughly after each measurement.",
      "Store the probe in the recommended storage solution or distilled water.",
      "Switch OFF the meter after use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the sensor area is free from air bubbles.",
      "Do not use the probe in solutions that could damage the platinum coating.",
      "Regularly calibrate the instrument for accurate results.",
      "Rinse the probe between different samples to avoid carryover.",
      "Avoid extreme temperatures during measurement."
