    "purpose": "To facilitate the rapid drying of solids or evaporation of solvents.",
    "scope": "Applicable to sample preparation in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the sample in a flat-bottomed dish or beaker.",
      "Set the hot plate to a low temperature to avoid charring.",
      "Place the container on the hot plate and stir periodically with a glass rod.",
      "Continue until the sample is completely dry.",
      "Remove the container using tongs and allow it to cool in a desiccator.",
      "Turn OFF the hot plate and clean any residues.",
      "Record the drying conditions in the analytical record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Perform the process in a fume hood if vapors are released.",
      "Do not leave the drying process unattended.",
      "Avoid overheating which may cause sample decomposition.",
      "Use appropriate safety gear to prevent thermal burns.",
      "Ensure the vessel is heat-resistant (Borosilicate glass)."
