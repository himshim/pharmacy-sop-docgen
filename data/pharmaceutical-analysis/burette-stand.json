    "purpose": "To describe the procedure for the safe and stable mounting of burettes for manual titration.",
    "scope": "Applicable to laboratory titration setups in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the burette stand on a level laboratory bench.",
      "Ensure the base of the stand is clean and the rod is securely screwed in.",
      "Attach the burette clamp (single or double) at the required height.",
      "Carefully insert the burette into the clamp and tighten the screws/springs.",
      "Verify that the burette is perfectly vertical using the rod as a guide.",
      "Place the titration flask or beaker directly under the burette tip.",
      "Adjust the height of the burette so the tip is slightly inside the neck of the flask.",
      "After the titration, carefully remove the burette for cleaning.",
      "Wipe the stand base if any chemical spills occur during use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not over-tighten the burette clamp as it may crack the glass.",
      "Ensure the stand base is heavy enough to prevent tipping when the burette is full.",
      "Keep the stand rod free from corrosion to ensure smooth clamp adjustment.",
      "Handle the burette carefully to avoid hitting the stand rod.",
      "Clean any acid or base spills on the base promptly to prevent etching."
