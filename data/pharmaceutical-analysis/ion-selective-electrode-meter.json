    "purpose": "To determine the concentration of specific ions in aqueous solutions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to potentiometric analysis in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Connect the specific Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) and reference electrode.",
      "Prepare standard calibration solutions of the target ion.",
      "Calibrate the meter across the expected concentration range.",
      "Rinse the electrodes with deionized water and blot dry.",
      "Immerse the electrodes in the sample solution and stir gently.",
      "Wait for the reading to stabilize and record the concentration.",
      "Rinse electrodes thoroughly between different samples.",
      "Store the ISE in the recommended storage solution when not in use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure proper Ionic Strength Adjustor (ISA) is added to all samples and standards.",
      "Handle the sensitive electrode membrane with extreme care.",
      "Avoid cross-contamination by thorough rinsing.",
      "Keep the reference electrode filled with the correct electrolyte.",
      "Calibrate the instrument daily before use."
