    "purpose": "To determine trace amounts of water in samples using coulometric titration.",
    "scope": "Applicable to moisture analysis in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the titration cell is clean and filled with fresh KF reagent.",
      "Power ON the instrument and allow the background moisture to be titrated (pre-titration).",
      "Wait until the drift stabilizes at a low value (typically <10 µg/min).",
      "Accurately weigh the sample and inject it into the titration cell.",
      "Enter the sample weight into the instrument controller.",
      "Start the titration and wait for the endpoint detection.",
      "Record the water content result (ppm or percentage) from the display.",
      "Perform replicates to ensure consistency.",
      "Clean the generator electrode and titration cell periodically."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Minimize exposure of reagents to atmospheric moisture.",
      "Ensure the septum is in good condition to prevent leaks.",
      "Handle toxic KF reagents with gloves inside a fume hood.",
      "Do not use coulometric KF for samples with high water content (>1%).",
      "Replace the molecular sieve in the drying tubes regularly."
