  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To determine moisture content in samples (>100 ppm) using automated volumetric titration.",
    "scope": "Applicable to moisture analysis in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the burette and tubing are primed with fresh KF titrant.",
      "Place solvent in the titration beaker and perform the 'pre-titration' step.",
      "Determine the titer (mg H2O/mL) using a standard water-in-methanol solution.",
      "Introduce the weighed sample into the titration vessel.",
      "Start the automatic titration program.",
      "Record the final result displayed after the endpoint is achieved.",
      "Clean the beaker and purge the lines if the instrument will be idle.",
      "Document all titer values and sample results in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Regularly check the desiccants in the drying tubes.",
      "Avoid splashing reagent onto the electrodes.",
      "Ensure the sample is completely dissolved for accurate results.",
      "Keep the titration beaker tightly capped at all times.",
      "Handle reagents with care in a well-ventilated area."
