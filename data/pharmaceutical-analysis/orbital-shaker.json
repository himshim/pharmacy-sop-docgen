    "purpose": "To provide a circular shaking motion for mixing samples and facilitating extractions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to sample preparation in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Secure the containers or flasks in the platform clamps.",
      "Ensure the load is balanced across the shaker platform.",
      "Power ON the unit and set the required RPM and time.",
      "Gradually increase the speed and monitor the shaking action.",
      "Once the timer ends, allow the platform to stop before removing samples.",
      "Clean the platform surface of any drips or residues.",
      "Switch OFF the power when the task is complete."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not exceed the maximum weight capacity of the platform.",
      "Ensure all clamps are tightened properly to prevent breakage.",
      "Check for unusual noise or vibration during high-speed runs.",
      "Avoid placing the shaker near the edge of the bench.",
      "Ensure the power cord is clear of moving parts."
