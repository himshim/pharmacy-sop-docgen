    "purpose": "To perform manual volumetric analysis using a burette and indicator.",
    "scope": "Applicable to quantitative analysis in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Rinse the burette with a small amount of the titrant solution.",
      "Fill the burette and ensure there are no air bubbles in the tip.",
      "Set the meniscus to the zero mark and record the initial reading.",
      "Place the sample flask containing an indicator under the burette.",
      "Add the titrant slowly while swirling the flask continuously.",
      "Titrate until a permanent color change (endpoint) is observed.",
      "Record the final burette reading.",
      "Empty and clean the burette and flask thoroughly."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Read the burette at eye level for accuracy.",
      "Ensure the stopcock is well-greased and leak-free.",
      "Do not add titrant too rapidly near the endpoint.",
      "Use a white tile under the flask for better color visualization.",
      "Check for proper illumination during the process."
