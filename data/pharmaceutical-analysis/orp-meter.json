    "purpose": "To measure the Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) of solutions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to electrochemical analysis in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Connect the ORP electrode to the meter and power ON.",
      "Verify the meter accuracy using a standard Zobell's or Quinhydrone solution.",
      "Rinse the electrode with distilled water and blot dry.",
      "Immerse the electrode in the sample and stir gently.",
      "Wait for the potential (mV) reading to stabilize.",
      "Record the value and the sample temperature.",
      "Rinse the electrode thoroughly after each use.",
      "Store the electrode in the recommended storage solution."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not touch or wipe the platinum sensing surface.",
      "Ensure the electrode is fully immersed in the sample.",
      "Regularly check the reference electrode filling solution level.",
      "Handle the electrode with care to avoid damage to the glass body.",
      "Calibrate or verify the instrument before each daily use."
