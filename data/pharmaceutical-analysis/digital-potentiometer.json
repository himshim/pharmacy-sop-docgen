    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for measuring potential differences in electrochemical cells.",
    "scope": "Applicable to potentiometric titrations in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the potentiometer and allow it to stabilize.",
      "Connect the reference and indicator electrodes to the input terminals.",
      "Calibrate the instrument against a standard potential if applicable.",
      "Immerse the electrodes into the sample solution and stir gently.",
      "Record the potential (mV) once the digital display is stable.",
      "Perform titration and record the potential change after each addition.",
      "Rinse the electrodes thoroughly with distilled water after use.",
      "Store the electrodes in the appropriate storage solution.",
      "Switch OFF the instrument and clean the surrounding area."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Handle the electrodes with care to avoid damage.",
      "Ensure proper electrode connections to avoid noise in the reading.",
      "Regularly check the reference electrode's internal liquid level.",
      "Avoid cross-contamination by rinsing electrodes between samples.",
      "Check the instrument calibration periodically."
