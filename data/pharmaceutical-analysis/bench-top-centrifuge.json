    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the separation of components in small volume samples using a bench-top centrifuge.",
    "scope": "Applicable to separation activities in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the centrifuge is placed on a flat, stable bench surface.",
      "Inspect the rotor and tube holders for cleanliness and integrity.",
      "Fill centrifuge tubes with equal volumes of sample to maintain balance.",
      "Place tubes in a symmetrical arrangement within the rotor buckets.",
      "Close the lid securely and verify that the safety latch is engaged.",
      "Set the required speed (RPM) and time on the digital controller.",
      "Start the centrifuge and wait for it to reach the set speed.",
      "Stop the unit immediately if excessive noise or vibration occurs.",
      "Allow the rotor to come to a complete stop before opening the lid.",
      "Carefully remove the tubes and proceed with analysis.",
      "Wipe the interior of the centrifuge after use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always balance the tubes by weight before starting the centrifuge.",
      "Do not attempt to open the lid or slow the rotor manually.",
      "Use only tubes that are rated for the maximum speed of the centrifuge.",
      "Ensure the rotor is properly seated on the drive shaft.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE to guard against potential splashes from tube failure."
