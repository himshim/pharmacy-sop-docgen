    "purpose": "To provide efficient mixing of liquid solutions using a rotating magnetic field.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical tasks in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the beaker on the stirrer platform.",
      "Add a clean magnetic stir bar into the beaker.",
      "Turn ON the power and slowly increase the stirring speed.",
      "Adjust for a smooth vortex without excessive splashing.",
      "Once mixing is complete, reduce the speed to zero and turn OFF.",
      "Retrieve the stir bar using a magnetic wand.",
      "Clean the platform and the stir bar after use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not use for highly viscous liquids.",
      "Ensure the stir bar is compatible with the solution chemicals.",
      "Avoid very high speeds that cause the bar to decouple.",
      "Protect the unit from chemical spills.",
      "Do not leave the stirrer running unattended at high speeds."
