    "procedure": [
      "Place the support base on the filtration flask and connect the vacuum.",
      "Place a membrane filter on the support using clean tweezers.",
      "Attach the funnel and secure with the clamp.",
      "Switch ON the vacuum pump.",
      "Pour the liquid into the funnel and allow it to pass through.",
      "Once complete, release the vacuum and remove the filter.",
      "Transfer the filtrate to a clean container.",
      "Clean and dry all parts of the assembly after use."

    "precautions": [
      "Do not touch the membrane filter with bare fingers.",
      "Ensure the filter is compatible with the solvent used.",
      "Check for leaks in the vacuum connections.",
      "Use thick-walled flasks for vacuum safety.",
      "Sanitize the assembly if used for microbiological work."
