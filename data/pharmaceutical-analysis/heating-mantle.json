  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for providing uniform heating for round-bottom flasks.",
    "scope": "Applicable to laboratory heating tasks in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Select a heating mantle that matches the flask size being used.",
      "Inspect the mantle for any chemical spills or fabric damage.",
      "Place the flask into the mantle and secure it with a clamp.",
      "Connect the mantle to a variable power controller.",
      "Gradually increase the heat and monitor the reaction temperature.",
      "After the process, turn OFF the controller and allow the mantle to cool.",
      "Wipe any spills from the mantle after it has cooled completely.",
      "Store the mantle in a dry, clean cabinet."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never plug the mantle directly into a wall outlet without a controller.",
      "Do not use a mantle if the heating fabric is torn or frayed.",
      "Ensure the flask is dry on the outside before heating.",
      "Do not leave the heating mantle unattended during use.",
      "Avoid contact of flammable solvents with the hot mantle surface."
