    "purpose": "To separate particles from liquids using centrifugal force.",
    "scope": "Applicable to sample preparation in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Inspect the rotor and tube holders for any damage.",
      "Fill centrifuge tubes with sample and ensure they are balanced by weight.",
      "Place the tubes symmetrically in the rotor buckets.",
      "Close the lid and set the speed (RPM) and time.",
      "Start the centrifuge and wait for it to reach the operating speed.",
      "Listen for any unusual noise and stop immediately if found.",
      "Allow the rotor to stop completely before opening the lid.",
      "Remove the tubes and clean the interior chamber.",
      "Document the run parameters in the equipment log."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never operate the centrifuge with an unbalanced load.",
      "Ensure the tubes are properly capped to prevent aerosols.",
      "Do not exceed the maximum rated speed of the rotor.",
      "Ensure the lid is locked before starting.",
      "Follow appropriate safety protocols for hazardous samples."
