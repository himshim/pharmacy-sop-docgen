  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for performing automated titrations with precise endpoint detection.",
    "scope": "Applicable to quantitative analysis in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the instrument is calibrated and the electrode is properly connected.",
      "Rinse the burette and tubing with the titrant to be used.",
      "Fill the titrant reservoir and ensure there are no air bubbles in the lines.",
      "Select the appropriate titration method on the control panel (e.g., acid-base, redox).",
      "Prepare the sample in a titration beaker and add a magnetic stir bar.",
      "Lower the electrode and titration tip into the sample solution.",
      "Start the titration; the instrument will automatically add titrant and monitor the potential/pH.",
      "Wait for the instrument to detect the endpoint and display the results.",
      "Record the titrant volume and the calculated concentration.",
      "Rinse the electrode and titration tip thoroughly with distilled water after each use.",
      "Empty and rinse the burette system if a different titrant is required."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Handle electrodes with care to prevent breakage or surface damage.",
      "Ensure the magnetic stirrer does not hit the electrode.",
      "Check for leaks in the tubing and connections regularly.",
      "Perform periodic calibration of the burette volume.",
      "Store electrodes in the appropriate storage solution when not in use."
