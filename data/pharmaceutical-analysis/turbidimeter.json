  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To measure the turbidity of liquids by assessing light scattering.",
    "scope": "Applicable to clarity testing in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Power ON the instrument and allow it to warm up for 15 minutes.",
      "Calibrate the instrument using standard Formazin solutions.",
      "Fill a clean, scratch-free cuvette with the sample liquid.",
      "Wipe the exterior of the cuvette and insert it into the cell holder.",
      "Record the turbidity reading in NTU from the display.",
      "Repeat measurements for consistency and average the results.",
      "Empty and clean the cuvette thoroughly after use.",
      "Switch OFF the instrument at the end of the day."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid creating air bubbles in the sample as they scatter light.",
      "Use only matched and high-quality cuvettes for measurement.",
      "Handle cuvettes only by the top to avoid fingerprints.",
      "Ensure the cuvette is correctly oriented in the cell holder.",
      "Store standards in a cool, dark place to maintain stability."
