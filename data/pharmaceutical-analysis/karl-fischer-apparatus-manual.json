  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To determine moisture content using manual volumetric KF titration.",
    "scope": "Applicable to moisture analysis in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Clean the titration flask and add a sufficient amount of dry methanol.",
      "Neutralize the methanol by adding KF reagent until the endpoint is reached.",
      "Standardize the KF reagent using a known amount of water or standard.",
      "Accurately weigh the sample and transfer it to the titration flask.",
      "Titrate the sample with KF reagent until the permanent endpoint (color change or dead-stop).",
      "Calculate the water content based on the volume of titrant used and its factor.",
      "Empty and clean the flask after completion.",
      "Store the KF reagent in an amber bottle away from light and moisture."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Keep the system tightly sealed to exclude atmospheric moisture.",
      "Perform standardization daily as the KF factor changes over time.",
      "Use a syringe or weighing boat to transfer samples quickly.",
      "Ensure thorough stirring throughout the titration.",
      "Wear PPE to handle hazardous methanol and iodine-based reagents."
