    "purpose": "To measure the EMF of electrochemical cells during potentiometric titrations.",
    "scope": "Applicable to quantitative analysis in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Connect the indicator and reference electrodes to the potentiometer.",
      "Switch ON the instrument and allow it to stabilize.",
      "Immerse the electrodes into the titration vessel containing the sample.",
      "Add the titrant in small increments while stirring continuously.",
      "Record the potential (mV) after each addition once stabilized.",
      "Determine the equivalence point from the potential vs volume curve.",
      "Rinse and store electrodes in appropriate solutions after use.",
      "Clean the titration setup and document the findings."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Maintain consistent stirring throughout the titration.",
      "Ensure the electrodes do not touch the magnetic stir bar.",
      "Regularly check the electrode connections for noise or drift.",
      "Use a high-impedance input for sensitive potential measurements.",
      "Clean electrodes between different samples to prevent carryover."
