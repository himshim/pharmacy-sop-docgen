    "purpose": "To measure the suspended particulate matter by light scattering.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analysis of turbid solutions in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the instrument and allow 15 minutes for stabilization.",
      "Calibrate using standard suspension (e.g., Formazin).",
      "Rinse the sample cell with deionized water.",
      "Fill the cell with the sample solution and wipe the exterior.",
      "Insert the cell and record the NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units).",
      "Perform replicates for better accuracy.",
      "Empty and clean the cell thoroughly after use.",
      "Switch OFF the instrument at the end of the day."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid air bubbles in the sample cell as they scatter light.",
      "Use a scratch-free, matched sample cell.",
      "Handle the cell by the top only to avoid fingerprints.",
      "Store the standard solutions in a cool, dark place.",
      "Maintain the optical window of the instrument clean."
