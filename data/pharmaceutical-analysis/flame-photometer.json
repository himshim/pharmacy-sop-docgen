    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the analysis of alkali metals using flame emission spectroscopy.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical chemistry tasks in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the instrument and allow it to warm up for 15 minutes.",
      "Connect the gas supply and air compressor.",
      "Ignite the flame and adjust for a stable blue cone.",
      "Aspirate distilled water to zero the instrument.",
      "Aspirate standard solutions to calibrate for the element (e.g., Na, K, Li).",
      "Aspirate the sample solution and record the intensity reading.",
      "Construct a calibration curve to determine the sample concentration.",
      "Aspirate distilled water for 5 minutes after use to clean the nebulizer.",
      "Turn OFF the gas and air supply and switch OFF the instrument.",
      "Document all observations and results in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure proper ventilation in the laboratory during operation.",
      "Check for gas leaks before igniting the flame.",
      "Do not aspirate highly concentrated or corrosive samples.",
      "Regularly clean the nebulizer and burner head.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE including safety glasses."
