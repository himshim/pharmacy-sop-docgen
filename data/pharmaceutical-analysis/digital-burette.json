    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for high-precision manual titrations using a digital burette.",
    "scope": "Applicable to quantitative analysis in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Mount the digital burette securely on the titrant bottle.",
      "Prime the burette by dispensing titrant back into the bottle until air bubbles are removed.",
      "Zero the digital display.",
      "Prepare the sample in a titration flask and place it under the burette tip.",
      "Turn the handwheels to dispense titrant slowly while stirring the sample.",
      "Slow down the addition as the expected endpoint approaches.",
      "Note the final volume from the digital display at the endpoint.",
      "Empty the burette and rinse with distilled water if it will not be used for some time.",
      "Store the burette as per manufacturer instructions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid using titrants that are incompatible with the burette materials (e.g., strong HF).",
      "Ensure there are no air bubbles in the dispensing cylinder or tip.",
      "Do not turn the handwheels beyond the stop points.",
      "Clean the burette tip regularly to prevent clogging.",
      "Calibrate the volume periodically according to the SOP."
