    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the measurement of solution conductivity using a bridge circuit.",
    "scope": "Applicable to electrochemical analysis in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Connect the conductivity cell to the bridge terminals.",
      "Switch ON the power and allow the instrument to stabilize.",
      "Select the appropriate range for the expected conductivity.",
      "Calibrate the bridge using a standard solution of known conductivity.",
      "Rinse the cell with distilled water and then with the sample solution.",
      "Immerse the cell in the sample and adjust the bridge balance for a null reading.",
      "Record the conductivity value from the calibrated scale.",
      "Rinse the cell thoroughly with distilled water after each use.",
      "Store the cell in distilled water to keep the electrodes conditioned."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid touching the platinum black coating on the electrode plates.",
      "Ensure the cell is fully immersed in the solution.",
      "Perform temperature compensation if the instrument allows.",
      "Check for air bubbles inside the cell as they affect the reading.",
      "Handle the glass cell with care to avoid breakage."
