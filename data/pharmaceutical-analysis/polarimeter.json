    "purpose": "To determine the optical rotation of chiral pharmaceutical substances.",
    "scope": "Applicable to identity and purity testing in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the sodium lamp and allow 20 minutes to reach full intensity.",
      "Fill the sample tube with solvent and zero the instrument.",
      "Prepare the sample solution at the specified concentration.",
      "Fill the tube with sample solution, ensuring no air bubbles are trapped.",
      "Place the tube in the compartment and determine the angle of rotation.",
      "Calculate the specific optical rotation based on concentration and path length.",
      "Clean the polarimeter tube thoroughly after use.",
      "Record the rotation angle, temperature, and wavelength used."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "The presence of air bubbles will cause significant measurement errors.",
      "Ensure the polarimeter tube windows are clean and free from scratches.",
      "Handle the sample tube carefully as it is a precision glass instrument.",
      "Always perform the blank (solvent) reading before the sample.",
      "Store the sodium lamp properly to maximize its lifespan."
