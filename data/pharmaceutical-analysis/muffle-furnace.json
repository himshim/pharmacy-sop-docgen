    "purpose": "To perform high-temperature heating for ashing and ignition tests.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical chemistry in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the furnace is placed on a heat-resistant surface.",
      "Power ON and set the required temperature on the controller.",
      "Place the sample in a silica or porcelain crucible.",
      "Slowly open the door and place the crucible inside.",
      "Close the door and allow the heating cycle to complete.",
      "Once finished, turn OFF the heater and allow it to cool to <200°C.",
      "Use long tongs to remove the crucible.",
      "Record the final weight after cooling in a desiccator.",
      "Document the temperature and ashing time."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always wear heat-resistant gloves and a face shield.",
      "Do not open the door at very high temperatures.",
      "Ensure proper exhaust for any fumes generated during ignition.",
      "Avoid placing flammable materials near the furnace.",
      "Inspect the interior for residues and clean regularly."
