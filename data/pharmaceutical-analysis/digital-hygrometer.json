    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for monitoring environmental humidity and temperature.",
    "scope": "Applicable to environmental control in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the hygrometer in the designated area of the laboratory.",
      "Ensure the instrument is away from direct sunlight and heat sources.",
      "Wait for the instrument to equilibrate with the environment (approx. 15 mins).",
      "Record the relative humidity (%) and temperature (°C) readings in the daily logbook.",
      "Check the maximum and minimum readings recorded since the last reset.",
      "Reset the Min/Max memory daily.",
      "Verify the accuracy of the hygrometer against a reference standard annually.",
      "Replace the batteries as soon as the display becomes faint."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not expose the sensor to corrosive chemical fumes.",
      "Avoid touching the sensor element directly.",
      "Ensure the hygrometer is used within its specified range.",
      "Keep the instrument clean and free from dust.",
      "Report any persistent out-of-range humidity levels."
