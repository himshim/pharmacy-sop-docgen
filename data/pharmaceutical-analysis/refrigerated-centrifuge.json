    "purpose": "To separate sample components at high speeds while maintaining temperature control.",
    "scope": "Applicable to heat-sensitive sample processing in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Set the desired temperature and allow the centrifuge to pre-cool.",
      "Balance the sample tubes by weight and place them in the rotor.",
      "Close the lid and set the speed (RPM) and run time.",
      "Start the centrifuge and monitor for any abnormal vibration.",
      "Wait for the rotor to come to a complete stop before opening.",
      "Remove the samples and wipe any condensation from the chamber.",
      "Turn OFF the unit and leave the lid slightly open for ventilation."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Strictly balance the tubes to within 0.1g of each other.",
      "Do not exceed the maximum RPM specified for the rotor.",
      "Ensure the rotor lid is securely fastened before starting.",
      "Clean any spills immediately to prevent rotor corrosion.",
      "Check the condition of the lid gaskets regularly."
