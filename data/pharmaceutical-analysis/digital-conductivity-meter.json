    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for measuring the conductivity of liquids with a digital interface.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical tasks in Pharmaceutical Analysis.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the meter and allow it to perform self-diagnostics.",
      "Calibrate the meter with a standard conductivity buffer.",
      "Rinse the conductivity electrode with distilled water and dry with a tissue.",
      "Place the electrode in the sample solution and wait for the stability indicator.",
      "Record the conductivity and temperature value displayed.",
      "Rinse the electrode thoroughly after each use.",
      "Store the electrode in the appropriate storage solution.",
      "Document the calibration and results in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Handle the electrode bulb with care.",
      "Keep the electrode submerged in the recommended storage liquid when not in use.",
      "Avoid cross-contamination by rinsing between samples.",
      "Check for the presence of air bubbles in the electrode sensing area.",
      "Perform daily calibration before starting measurements."
