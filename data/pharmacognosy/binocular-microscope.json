    "title": "Operation of Binocular Microscope"
  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To examine morphological and histological features of crude drugs using binocular observation.",
    "scope": "Applicable to microscopic identification and evaluation in Pharmacognosy.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the microscope on a stable table and connect to power.",
      "Switch ON the light source and adjust brightness.",
      "Place the prepared slide on the stage and secure with stage clips.",
      "Start with the lowest magnification objective and use coarse focus, then refine with fine focus.",
      "Center the area of interest and switch to higher magnification if needed.",
      "Adjust interpupillary distance and diopter settings for comfortable binocular viewing.",
      "After observation, lower the stage, remove the slide, switch OFF the light, and cover the microscope."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not use coarse focus at high magnification to avoid damaging slides or objectives.",
      "Clean lenses only with approved lens tissue and cleaning solution.",
      "Avoid touching optical surfaces with fingers.",
      "Keep the microscope covered when not in use to prevent dust deposition.",
      "Have the instrument serviced and aligned periodically."
