    "purpose": "To dry and store moisture-sensitive samples in a low-humidity environment.",
    "scope": "Applicable to drying plant powders, ash residues, and weighed samples in Pharmacognosy.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place an appropriate desiccant (e.g., silica gel) in the lower compartment of the desiccator.",
      "Arrange samples in crucibles or containers on the perforated plate without overlapping.",
      "Apply a thin film of vacuum grease to the desiccator lid if using a vacuum desiccator.",
      "Close the lid securely and, if applicable, connect to a vacuum pump and evacuate gently.",
      "Allow samples to cool or dry to constant weight as required by the procedure.",
      "Release vacuum slowly (if used) before opening and removing samples."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not place hot samples directly into a vacuum desiccator; allow slight cooling first.",
      "Handle glass desiccators carefully to avoid breakage or implosion.",
      "Regenerate or replace desiccant when color indicators show saturation.",
      "Avoid scratching the ground-glass joint surfaces.",
      "Do not tilt or carry the desiccator by the lid."
