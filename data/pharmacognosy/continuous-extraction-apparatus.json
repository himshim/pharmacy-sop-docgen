  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To continuously extract active constituents from plant material using suitable solvents.",
    "scope": "Applicable to large-scale extraction in Pharmacognosy and phytochemistry work.",
    "procedure": [
      "Weigh and load the coarsely powdered plant material into the thimble or extraction chamber.",
      "Assemble the continuous extraction apparatus (e.g., Soxhlet-type) with round-bottom flask, condenser, and heating mantle.",
      "Add the required volume of extraction solvent to the flask and check all joints for tightness.",
      "Start heating to initiate solvent boiling and siphoning cycles through the plant material.",
      "Allow the extraction to continue for the specified number of cycles or time.",
      "After completion, cool the system, disconnect, and concentrate the extract as required.",
      "Clean and dry glassware and joints thoroughly after use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use appropriate boiling stones or anti-bumping granules in the flask.",
      "Ensure proper water circulation in the condenser.",
      "Do not heat flammable solvents near open flames; use mantle or water bath.",
      "Secure glass joints with clips to prevent disconnection during operation.",
      "Handle hot glassware and solvents with heat-resistant gloves."
