  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To determine the angle of repose of powdered crude drugs and extracts as a measure of flow properties.",
    "scope": "Applicable to pre-formulation and powder flow characterization in Pharmacognosy.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the apparatus on a level bench and ensure the funnel outlet is closed.",
      "Fill the funnel with a known quantity of dry, sieved powder.",
      "Position a graph paper or base plate below the funnel at a fixed height.",
      "Open the outlet to allow powder to flow freely and form a conical heap.",
      "Measure the height (h) of the heap and the radius (r) of the base.",
      "Calculate the angle of repose using the formula: tan(θ) = h / r.",
      "Record the results with powder identification and conditions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure powder is dry and free-flowing before testing.",
      "Avoid vibration or air currents during measurement.",
      "Use consistent funnel height for all determinations.",
      "Clean the apparatus thoroughly between different powders.",
      "Wear a mask when working with fine or allergenic plant powders."
