  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To weigh small quantities of samples with high precision for pharmacognosy experiments.",
    "scope": "Applicable to accurate weighing of plant extracts, standards, and reagents in the Pharmacognosy laboratory.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the analytical balance on a stable, vibration-free surface inside a low-draft area.",
      "Switch ON the balance and allow it to warm up and self-calibrate if applicable.",
      "Ensure the weighing chamber and pan are clean and free from dust or spilled material.",
      "Close all glass doors, press the TARE key to zero the display, and place a clean weighing container on the pan.",
      "Close the doors again, press TARE to re-zero, then carefully add sample until the desired mass is reached.",
      "Record the stable reading and transfer the weighed material to the working container using a spatula.",
      "After use, remove the container, gently clean any spills, and close the balance doors."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not exceed the maximum capacity of the balance.",
      "Avoid drafts, air conditioning vents, and direct sunlight near the balance.",
      "Do not touch the weighing pan directly with hands or contaminated tools.",
      "Use anti-static measures for very light powders if necessary.",
      "Schedule periodic calibration and verification with certified weights."
