    "purpose": "To perform routine weighing of samples and reagents with moderate precision.",
    "scope": "Applicable to general-purpose weighing in the Pharmacognosy laboratory.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the balance on a level surface and verify the level indicator if present.",
      "Switch ON the balance and allow it to stabilize.",
      "Ensure the pan is clean, then place a weighing paper or container and press TARE.",
      "Add the required quantity of material until the desired weight is achieved.",
      "Record the reading once it is stable.",
      "Remove the load and clean any spilled material from the pan."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overload beyond the balance capacity.",
      "Keep the balance away from strong drafts and vibrations.",
      "Never weigh corrosive materials directly on the pan.",
      "Calibrate the balance at defined intervals.",
      "Turn OFF or place in standby mode as per lab policy when not in use."
