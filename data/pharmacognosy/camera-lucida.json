    "purpose": "To obtain accurate line drawings of microscopic structures by superimposing the image on drawing paper.",
    "scope": "Applicable to morphological and anatomical illustration of crude drugs in Pharmacognosy.",
    "procedure": [
      "Attach the camera lucida device to the microscope eyepiece as per manufacturer instructions.",
      "Place white drawing paper on the stage or adjacent drawing surface.",
      "Adjust mirrors and prisms until the specimen image and drawing surface appear in the same field of view.",
      "Focus the specimen clearly through the microscope.",
      "Trace the outline and internal structures of the specimen while viewing through the eyepiece.",
      "Label important features and remove the device after use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Handle the optical components delicately to avoid misalignment.",
      "Work under comfortable illumination to avoid eye strain.",
      "Ensure the microscope is securely fixed before attaching the device.",
