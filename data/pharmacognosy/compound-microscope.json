    "purpose": "To examine thin sections and powdered crude drugs at various magnifications.",
    "scope": "Applicable to detailed microscopical analysis in Pharmacognosy practicals and research.",
    "procedure": [
      "Set up the microscope on a firm bench and connect to the power supply.",
      "Switch ON the illumination and center the condenser for even lighting.",
      "Place the prepared slide on the stage and secure it with clips.",
      "Using the low-power objective, bring the specimen into focus with the coarse knob, then refine with the fine knob.",
      "Change to higher-power objectives as needed and adjust the diaphragm for contrast.",
      "After observation, rotate the nosepiece to low power, lower the stage, remove the slide, and turn OFF the light."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never use coarse focus under oil immersion objective.",
      "Clean oil from immersion objective immediately after use.",
      "Avoid scratching slides or objectives by lowering them carefully.",
      "Protect the microscope from dust and moisture with a cover.",
      "Schedule regular servicing and alignment."
