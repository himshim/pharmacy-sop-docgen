    "purpose": "To store plant extracts, reference standards, and temperature-sensitive samples at sub-zero temperatures.",
    "scope": "Applicable to medium- and long-term preservation of pharmacognostic materials.",
    "procedure": [
      "Set the freezer temperature to the required level (e.g., -20°C or -40°C) and allow stabilization.",
      "Place samples in sealed, labeled containers or vials with clear identification and date.",
      "Organize samples in racks or boxes to minimize door-open time during retrieval.",
      "Monitor and log internal temperature at least once daily.",
      "Defrost the freezer periodically if excessive ice buildup occurs.",
      "Clean the interior during defrost cycles with suitable disinfectant and dry thoroughly."

    "precautions": [
      "Avoid frequent, prolonged door openings.",
      "Do not overload shelves beyond manufacturer recommendations.",
      "Use insulated gloves when handling frozen samples.",
      "Connect the freezer to backup power if storing critical materials.",
      "Check door gasket condition regularly to ensure a proper seal."
