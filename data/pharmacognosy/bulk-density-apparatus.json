    "title": "Operation of Bulk Density Apparatus"
  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To determine bulk density and tapped density of powdered crude drugs and extracts.",
    "scope": "Applicable to physical characterization of plant powders in Pharmacognosy.",
    "procedure": [
      "Weigh an empty graduated cylinder and record its weight.",
      "Fill the cylinder with a known mass of powder without compacting and note the initial volume (bulk volume).",
      "Mount the cylinder on the bulk/tapped density apparatus.",
      "Set the number of taps and tap height as per pharmacopeial guidelines.",
      "Start the apparatus and allow it to complete the tapping cycle.",
      "Record the final volume (tapped volume) and calculate bulk and tapped densities.",
      "Compute Carr's index and Hausner ratio if required."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the cylinder is dry and clean before use.",
      "Avoid loss of powder during filling and tapping.",
      "Use the same powder sample for both bulk and tapped measurements.",
      "Keep the apparatus on a stable surface to avoid additional vibration.",
      "Wear a mask when handling fine powders."
