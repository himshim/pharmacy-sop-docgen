    "purpose": "To measure and monitor relative humidity in Pharmacognosy laboratories and storage areas.",
    "scope": "Applicable to environmental monitoring for crude drug storage and stability rooms.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the digital hygrometer and allow a few minutes for sensor stabilization.",
      "Place or mount the instrument at representative locations away from direct airflow or sunlight.",
      "Observe and record relative humidity (and temperature, if available) at scheduled times.",
      "Compare readings with acceptable limits for the specific room or cabinet.",
      "Replace or recalibrate sensors as per manufacturer recommendations."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not expose the sensor to liquid water or corrosive vapors.",
      "Avoid placing the hygrometer directly above heaters or near windows.",
      "Check battery status regularly and replace when low.",
      "Verify accuracy periodically against a calibrated reference.",
      "Handle the device gently to avoid sensor damage."
