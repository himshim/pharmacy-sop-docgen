    "purpose": "To store crude drugs and herbal samples at defined temperature and humidity conditions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to stability studies and storage of hygroscopic plant materials in Pharmacognosy.",
    "procedure": [
      "Set the desired temperature and relative humidity on the control panel according to the study protocol.",
      "Allow the cabinet to reach and stabilize at set conditions.",
      "Place labeled samples on the shelves without blocking air circulation vents.",
      "Monitor and record temperature and humidity readings at defined intervals.",
      "Open the door only when necessary and for the shortest time possible.",
      "At the end of the study, remove samples, download any logged data, and clean the interior."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overload the cabinet beyond rated capacity.",
      "Use only distilled or deionized water in humidity reservoirs to prevent scaling.",
      "Check door seals regularly for proper closure.",
      "Calibrate sensors for temperature and humidity at scheduled intervals.",
      "Connect critical cabinets to backup power if available."
