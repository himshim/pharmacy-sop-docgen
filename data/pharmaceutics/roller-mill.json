    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Roller Mill for size reduction using compression and shearing action.",
    "scope": "Applicable to milling activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check rollers for cleanliness and ensure they are free from residues.",
      "Adjust the gap between rollers according to required particle size.",
      "Power ON the mill and check for proper roller rotation.",
      "Feed the material uniformly into the hopper.",
      "Monitor the milled output and collect in appropriate containers.",
      "Adjust feed rate if the mill shows signs of overloading.",
      "Stop the mill after processing and allow it to cool.",
      "Clean the rollers and hopper thoroughly after use.",
      "Document milling settings and product yield in the record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Maintain safe distance from moving rollers during operation.",
      "Do not feed hard foreign objects that could damage roller surfaces.",
      "Check roller alignment regularly to ensure uniform milling.",
      "Clean rollers immediately to prevent material buildup/hardening.",
      "Wear hearing and eye protection during operation."
