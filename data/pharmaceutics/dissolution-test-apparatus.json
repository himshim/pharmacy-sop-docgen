    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Dissolution Test Apparatus for determination of drug release profile from tablets and capsules as per pharmacopeial methods.",
    "scope": "Applicable to dissolution testing activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the dissolution apparatus is placed on a stable, level platform.",
      "Verify that all vessels, paddles or baskets, and shafts are clean and calibrated.",
      "Check vessel alignment and ensure they are properly positioned.",
      "Select appropriate dissolution method (Apparatus 1-Basket or Apparatus 2-Paddle).",
      "Install appropriate paddles or baskets as per the selected method.",
      "Fill each vessel with specified volume of dissolution medium (typically 900 mL).",
      "Set the temperature controller to 37 ± 0.5°C.",
      "Allow the medium to reach and equilibrate at set temperature (30 minutes minimum).",
      "Verify temperature in each vessel using calibrated thermometer.",
      "Set the rotation speed as per method (typically 50-100 rpm).",
      "Deaerate dissolution medium if specified in the method.",
      "Place dosage units (tablets or capsules) into each vessel at time zero.",
      "Start the rotation and timer simultaneously.",
      "Cover vessels to minimize evaporation if testing for extended periods.",
      "Withdraw samples at specified time intervals using appropriate sampling device.",
      "Filter samples immediately through specified filter or use cannula filters.",
      "Replace withdrawn volume with fresh medium maintained at 37°C if specified.",
      "Analyze samples using validated analytical method (UV, HPLC, etc.).",
      "Calculate percent drug dissolved at each time point.",
      "Plot dissolution profile and evaluate against acceptance criteria.",
      "After testing, stop rotation and remove dosage units or residues.",
      "Clean all vessels, paddles, and equipment thoroughly.",
      "Document all dissolution data, observations, and calculations in the validation record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Maintain temperature at 37 ± 0.5°C throughout the test.",
      "Ensure proper paddle or basket positioning (25 mm from vessel bottom).",
      "Avoid introducing air bubbles during dosage unit placement.",
      "Use appropriate rotation speed as per pharmacopeial method.",
      "Filter samples promptly to stop dissolution process.",
      "Handle sinkers properly if required for capsules.",
      "Verify medium volume and pH as per method requirements.",
      "Perform mechanical calibration regularly.",
      "Clean apparatus thoroughly to prevent carryover.",
      "Follow cGMP and GLP practices during testing."
