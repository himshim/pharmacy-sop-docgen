  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of High Speed Homogenizer for particle size reduction and uniform dispersion of pharmaceutical emulsions, suspensions, and semi-solid preparations.",
    "scope": "Applicable to homogenization activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the homogenizer is placed on a stable surface or properly mounted.",
      "Verify that the rotor-stator assembly is clean and properly installed.",
      "Check that all electrical connections are secure.",
      "Select appropriate rotor-stator attachment based on product viscosity and batch size.",
      "Prepare the product or pre-mix in an appropriate container.",
      "Immerse the rotor-stator assembly into the product ensuring proper depth.",
      "Ensure sufficient product depth to cover the rotor-stator completely.",
      "Power ON the homogenizer at low speed initially.",
      "Gradually increase speed to the desired level for homogenization.",
      "Move the homogenizer slowly through the product if necessary for large batches.",
      "Maintain rotor-stator immersion to avoid air incorporation.",
      "Monitor product temperature during processing.",
      "Continue homogenization for the required duration to achieve desired particle size.",
      "For temperature-sensitive products, use jacketed vessels or ice bath for cooling.",
      "Reduce speed gradually before stopping the homogenizer.",
      "Power OFF and remove the rotor-stator from the product.",
      "Rinse the rotor-stator immediately with appropriate solvent.",
      "Disassemble rotor-stator assembly for thorough cleaning.",
      "Inspect for wear or damage and replace if necessary.",
      "Verify product uniformity and particle size if required.",
      "Document homogenization speed, time, and observations in the batch record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never operate the homogenizer without product immersion as it may cause damage.",
      "Avoid excessive speed that can cause product heating or degradation.",
      "Do not introduce air bubbles by keeping rotor-stator fully immersed.",
      "Monitor temperature continuously for heat-sensitive products.",
      "Use appropriate container size to ensure proper immersion depth.",
      "Clean rotor-stator immediately after use to prevent product hardening.",
      "Inspect rotor-stator regularly for wear and replace when damaged.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE including safety goggles, gloves, and lab coat.",
      "Ensure proper grounding to prevent electrical hazards.",
      "Follow lockout/tagout procedures during maintenance."
