    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Sieve Shaker for particle size classification.",
    "scope": "Applicable to powder analysis activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Select and stack sieves in descending order of mesh size.",
      "Weigh the powder sample and place it on the top sieve.",
      "Secure the sieve stack on the shaker and tighten the clamp.",
      "Set the shaking time and intensity.",
      "Start the shaker and allow it to run for the set duration.",
      "Remove the sieves and weigh the powder retained on each.",
      "Calculate particle size distribution percentage.",
      "Clean the sieves gently using a brush or compressed air.",
      "Document results and sieve mesh numbers in the analytical record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overload sieves as it affects separation efficiency.",
      "Handle sieves carefully to avoid damaging the mesh.",
      "Ensure the clamp is tight to prevent vibration noise and damage.",
      "Clean sieves thoroughly to avoid sample cross-contamination.",
      "Use calibrated sieves for official pharmacopeial testing."
