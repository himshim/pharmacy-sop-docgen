    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Tapped Density Apparatus for powder characterization.",
    "scope": "Applicable to powder analysis activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Weigh an appropriate amount of powder and transfer to a graduated cylinder.",
      "Record the initial unsettled volume (bulk volume).",
      "Secure the cylinder onto the tapping platform of the apparatus.",
      "Set the number of taps as per USP/IP requirements (e.g., 500, 750, 1250).",
      "Start the apparatus and allow it to complete the tapping cycle.",
      "Record the volume after each tapping interval.",
      "Continue until the volume difference between consecutive tests is negligible.",
      "Note the final tapped volume.",
      "Calculate bulk density, tapped density, Carr's index, and Hausner ratio.",
      "Clean the cylinder and apparatus after the test."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid vibrating the cylinder during the initial volume measurement.",
      "Ensure the cylinder is properly clamped to prevent breakage.",
      "Maintain constant tapping height as per standard specifications.",
      "Use dry cylinders to prevent powder sticking.",
      "Record environmental humidity as it may influence results."
