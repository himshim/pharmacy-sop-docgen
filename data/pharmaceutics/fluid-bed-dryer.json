    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Fluid Bed Dryer for efficient drying of pharmaceutical granules, powders, and wet materials using heated fluidized air.",
    "scope": "Applicable to fluid bed drying activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the fluid bed dryer is installed in a clean area with proper ventilation.",
      "Verify that all electrical connections, compressed air, and exhaust systems are functioning.",
      "Check that the product bowl, filter bags, and expansion chamber are clean.",
      "Inspect inlet and outlet air filters for cleanliness and proper installation.",
      "Power ON the fluid bed dryer and initialize the control system.",
      "Set process parameters including inlet air temperature, air flow rate, and drying time.",
      "Start the blower and establish proper air flow through the system.",
      "Allow the system to reach set temperature before loading material.",
      "Load wet granules or material into the product bowl (50-70% capacity).",
      "Close the bowl lid securely and ensure proper sealing.",
      "Start the heating system and monitor inlet air temperature.",
      "Monitor product temperature using temperature probe.",
      "Observe fluidization pattern to ensure uniform fluidization of material.",
      "Adjust air flow if fluidization is inadequate or excessive.",
      "Continue drying until product moisture content reaches target level.",
      "Take samples periodically and test for moisture content using LOD or other methods.",
      "Once target moisture is achieved, stop heating but continue air flow for cooling.",
      "Allow product to cool to room temperature before unloading.",
      "Open discharge valve and collect dried material in appropriate containers.",
      "Clean the product bowl, filters, and equipment thoroughly after use.",
      "Shake or pulse filter bags to remove adhered powder.",
      "Document all drying parameters, moisture data, and observations in the batch record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overload the product bowl as it restricts proper fluidization.",
      "Monitor inlet air temperature continuously to prevent product degradation.",
      "Ensure proper fluidization to achieve uniform drying.",
      "Check filter bags regularly and clean or replace when clogged.",
      "Avoid over-drying which may cause product degradation.",
      "Monitor product temperature to prevent overheating of heat-sensitive materials.",
      "Ensure proper exhaust to remove moisture-laden air.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE including heat-resistant gloves, mask, and safety shoes.",
      "Follow lockout/tagout procedures during cleaning and maintenance.",
      "Clean thoroughly between different products to prevent cross-contamination."
