    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Freeze Dryer (Lyophilizer) for preservation of heat-sensitive pharmaceutical products and biologicals by sublimation of frozen water under vacuum.",
    "scope": "Applicable to lyophilization activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the freeze dryer is installed with proper vacuum system and refrigeration.",
      "Verify that the vacuum pump oil is at proper level and condenser is clean.",
      "Check that all door seals and gaskets are in good condition.",
      "Power ON the freeze dryer and refrigeration system.",
      "Set condenser temperature (typically -40°C to -80°C) and allow to stabilize.",
      "Verify that condenser has reached set temperature before starting.",
      "Prepare product solution and fill into appropriate vials or trays.",
      "Pre-freeze the product at -40°C to -80°C in a separate freezer if required.",
      "Load frozen product carefully onto the freeze dryer shelves.",
      "Close the chamber door and ensure proper sealing.",
      "Start the vacuum pump and evacuate the chamber to desired vacuum level.",
      "Monitor vacuum level (typically 50-200 mTorr for primary drying).",
      "Set shelf temperature program for primary drying phase.",
      "Gradually increase shelf temperature while maintaining vacuum.",
      "Monitor product temperature using thermocouples or resistance probes.",
      "Continue primary drying until ice sublimation is complete (several hours to days).",
      "Transition to secondary drying phase by increasing shelf temperature further.",
      "Continue secondary drying to remove bound water (typically 25°C to 40°C).",
      "Monitor moisture content and end point using pressure rise test or other methods.",
      "Once drying is complete, cool the product under vacuum.",
      "Backfill the chamber with dry nitrogen or air to atmospheric pressure.",
      "Open chamber door and remove dried product immediately for stoppering or packaging.",
      "Clean the chamber, shelves, and condenser as per cleaning procedures.",
      "Defrost condenser and drain collected ice water.",
      "Document all lyophilization parameters, cycle duration, and product characteristics."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure product is completely frozen before starting vacuum to prevent boiling.",
      "Maintain proper vacuum level throughout the process.",
      "Do not exceed maximum shelf temperature for heat-sensitive products.",
      "Monitor condenser temperature to ensure efficient ice trapping.",
      "Defrost condenser regularly to maintain capacity.",
      "Check for vacuum leaks before starting the cycle.",
      "Use dry nitrogen for backfilling to prevent moisture introduction.",
      "Handle freeze-dried products in controlled humidity environment.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE and handle cryogenic materials with insulated gloves.",
      "Follow aseptic techniques for sterile product lyophilization."
