    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Controlled Temperature Chamber for storage and testing of pharmaceutical products at specific temperature conditions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to temperature-controlled storage activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the chamber is installed in a location with adequate ventilation and power supply.",
      "Verify that the chamber is connected to a stable power source with surge protection.",
      "Check that the temperature controller and sensors are functioning properly.",
      "Power ON the controlled temperature chamber using the main switch.",
      "Set the desired temperature using the digital controller or touchscreen interface.",
      "Allow the chamber to reach the set temperature and stabilize (may take 1-2 hours).",
      "Verify that the temperature display matches the set point.",
      "Check the calibration certificate and ensure the chamber is within calibration period.",
      "Place temperature mapping probes if conducting validation or mapping studies.",
      "Organize products or samples to allow proper air circulation inside the chamber.",
      "Load samples or products ensuring they do not block air vents or sensors.",
      "Close the chamber door securely to maintain temperature stability.",
      "Monitor temperature continuously through the display or data logger.",
      "Record temperature readings at specified intervals as per protocol.",
      "Verify that temperature remains within acceptable range throughout storage period.",
      "Set temperature alarms for out-of-specification conditions if available.",
      "For long-term storage, maintain a temperature log chart or automated monitoring.",
      "Periodically inspect door seals and gaskets for proper sealing.",
      "After sample removal, close door promptly to minimize temperature fluctuation.",
      "Clean the chamber interior periodically with appropriate cleaning agents.",
      "Perform regular calibration and preventive maintenance as per schedule.",
      "Document all temperature data, deviations, and corrective actions in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overload the chamber as it restricts air circulation.",
      "Avoid frequent door opening which causes temperature fluctuations.",
      "Ensure door is properly closed after each access.",
      "Do not place hot items directly in the chamber.",
      "Monitor temperature continuously for critical samples.",
      "Investigate and document any temperature excursions immediately.",
      "Keep the chamber exterior clean and free from obstructions.",
      "Ensure backup power supply for critical storage applications.",
      "Verify alarm functionality regularly.",
      "Perform regular calibration to ensure accuracy of temperature readings."
