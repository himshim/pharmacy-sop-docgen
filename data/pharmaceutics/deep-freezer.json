    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Deep Freezer for storage of temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical products, biologicals, and samples at ultra-low temperatures.",
    "scope": "Applicable to frozen storage activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the deep freezer is installed on a level surface with adequate ventilation around compressor.",
      "Verify that the freezer is connected to a dedicated power supply with backup if needed.",
      "Power ON the deep freezer using the main power switch.",
      "Set the desired storage temperature (typically -20°C to -80°C) using the controller.",
      "Allow the freezer to reach set temperature before loading any products (may take several hours).",
      "Verify temperature stability using calibrated thermometer or temperature probe.",
      "Check that the temperature display matches the set point.",
      "Organize products in labeled boxes or racks for easy identification and retrieval.",
      "Pre-cool products gradually if possible before placing in deep freezer.",
      "Open the freezer door only when necessary and for minimum duration.",
      "Load products ensuring proper air circulation and not blocking vents.",
      "Close the door securely ensuring proper seal.",
      "Monitor temperature continuously through display or data logging system.",
      "Record temperature readings at specified intervals as per protocol.",
      "Set temperature alarms for out-of-specification conditions.",
      "Maintain inventory log of all products stored with location details.",
      "Defrost the freezer periodically if manual defrost type (follow manufacturer guidelines).",
      "Check door gaskets regularly for proper sealing and replace if damaged.",
      "Clean interior surfaces periodically with appropriate cleaning agents.",
      "Perform regular preventive maintenance and calibration as per schedule.",
      "Document all temperature data, deviations, and corrective actions in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Minimize door opening frequency and duration to maintain temperature.",
      "Never place hot or warm items directly in the freezer.",
      "Use cryogenic gloves when handling items stored at ultra-low temperatures.",
      "Ensure proper ventilation around the freezer compressor unit.",
      "Install temperature monitoring system with alarm for critical storage.",
      "Have backup power supply or contingency plan for power failures.",
      "Do not overload the freezer beyond rated capacity.",
      "Investigate and document any temperature excursions immediately.",
      "Keep emergency contact numbers accessible for equipment failures.",
      "Perform regular calibration to ensure temperature accuracy."
