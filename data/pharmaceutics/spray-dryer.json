    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Spray Dryer for producing dry powders from liquid feeds.",
    "scope": "Applicable to powder manufacturing activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check cleanliness of drying chamber, cyclone, and nozzles.",
      "Set inlet air temperature and start the blower.",
      "Once inlet temp is stable, start feeding deionized water to stabilize outlet temp.",
      "Switch from water to the product feed once conditions are steady.",
      "Adjust feed rate and atomization air pressure for desired particle size.",
      "Collect the dried powder from the collection vessel periodically.",
      "Monitor inlet and outlet temperatures throughout the run.",
      "After completion, flush the system with water before shutdown.",
      "Allow the unit to cool before dismantling for cleaning.",
      "Document all temperature, pressure, and yield data in the batch record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the nozzle is not clogged before starting the feed.",
      "Maintain stable outlet temperature to ensure uniform product moisture.",
      "Monitor for powder accumulation on chamber walls.",
      "Handle dried powders in a controlled environment.",
      "Use appropriate PPE for handling fine airborne particles."
