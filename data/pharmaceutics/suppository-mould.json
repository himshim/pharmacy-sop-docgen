    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Suppository Mould for preparation of suppositories by pour molding technique.",
    "scope": "Applicable to semi-solid manufacturing activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Verify that the mould cavities are clean, dry, and free from debris.",
      "Ensure the mould halves are properly aligned and tightly secured.",
      "Prepare the suppository base and medicament mixture as per the formulation.",
      "Melt the base and incorporate active ingredients at specified temperature.",
      "Apply a thin layer of suitable lubricant to the mould cavities if required.",
      "Pour the molten mass into the cavities until they are slightly overfilled.",
      "Allow the mould to cool at room temperature followed by refrigeration.",
      "Once solidified, scrape off the excess mass from the top of the mould.",
      "Open the mould carefully and remove the finished suppositories.",
      "Inspect for uniform appearance, weight, and absence of air bubbles.",
      "Clean the mould thoroughly with warm water or appropriate solvent after use.",
      "Store the mould in a dry place to prevent corrosion or damage."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overheat the suppository base as it may affect solidification.",
      "Ensure uniform mixing of medicament in the molten base.",
      "Avoid using excessive lubricant which can affect the appearance.",
      "Allow sufficient cooling time before attempting to open the mould.",
      "Handle the mould surfaces carefully to avoid scratches."
