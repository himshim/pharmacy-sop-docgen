    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Perforated Coating Pan for efficient film coating of tablets with automated drying.",
    "scope": "Applicable to tablet coating activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Verify cleanliness of the perforated drum and spray system.",
      "Check inlet/exhaust air systems and temperature controllers.",
      "Load tablets into the drum (fill to recommended capacity).",
      "Set process parameters: inlet air temp, air flow, and drum speed.",
      "Start drum rotation and establish drying air flow.",
      "Position spray guns at correct distance and angle from tablet bed.",
      "Initiate coating spray at controlled rate.",
      "Monitor tablet bed temperature and weight gain throughout the process.",
      "After spraying, perform final drying and cooling phases.",
      "Unload coated tablets and inspect for quality defects.",
      "Clean the drum, nozzles, and exhaust filters immediately.",
      "Document all coating parameters and yield in the batch record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Maintain balanced spray rate and drying air to prevent sticking.",
      "Ensure proper drum loading for uniform coating distribution.",
      "Clean spray nozzles regularly to prevent clogging.",
      "Monitor exhaust air filters to maintain proper airflow.",
      "Follow validated cleaning SOPs for product changeover."
