    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Tablet Friability Tester to evaluate the physical strength of tablets.",
    "scope": "Applicable to quality control activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the friability drum is clean and properly attached to the shaft.",
      "Select 10 or 20 tablets (or weight equivalent to 6.5g) for testing.",
      "De-dust the tablets and weigh them accurately on an analytical balance (W1).",
      "Place the tablets inside the friability drum.",
      "Set the rotation speed to 25 rpm and timer to 4 minutes (100 rotations).",
      "Start the tester and monitor the tumbling action.",
      "After 100 rotations, remove the tablets from the drum.",
      "De-dust the tablets again and weigh them accurately (W2).",
      "Calculate the percentage friability: (W1 - W2) / W1 * 100.",
      "Check for any broken or cracked tablets after the test.",
      "Document the results and verify against pharmacopeial limits (typically <1%)."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure tablets are thoroughly de-dusted before both weighings.",
      "Do not test tablets that are already broken or chipped.",
      "Clean the drum interior between different batches.",
      "Ensure the drum is securely locked before starting the motor.",
      "Record any unusual observations like capping or lamination."
