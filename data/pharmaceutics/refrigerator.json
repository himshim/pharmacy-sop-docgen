    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation and maintenance of Refrigerator for cold storage of pharmaceutical materials.",
    "scope": "Applicable to storage activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the unit is connected to a stabilized power source.",
      "Set the thermostat to maintain temperature between 2°C and 8°C.",
      "Allow the unit to stabilize and verify temperature with a calibrated thermometer.",
      "Organize materials to allow proper air circulation inside the unit.",
      "Load samples ensuring they are labeled and stored in correct sections.",
      "Monitor and record temperature twice daily in the logbook.",
      "Periodically check door seals for proper insulation.",
      "Defrost and clean the interior surfaces as per maintenance schedule.",
      "Document any temperature excursions and corrective actions.",
      "Perform annual calibration of the temperature sensors."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Minimize door opening frequency to maintain temperature stability.",
      "Do not store food or beverages in pharmaceutical refrigerators.",
      "Do not overload shelves as it restricts cold air flow.",
      "Notify maintenance immediately if temperature exceeds set limits.",
      "Ensure backup power for critical storage items."
