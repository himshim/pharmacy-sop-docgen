    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Ointment Mill for particle size reduction and homogenization of ointments and semi-solid preparations.",
    "scope": "Applicable to semi-solid manufacturing activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Verify that the mill rollers/plates are clean and properly aligned.",
      "Check utility connections and cooling water supply if applicable.",
      "Set the gap between rollers as per desired fineness.",
      "Power ON the mill and check for smooth rotation.",
      "Feed the pre-mixed ointment base into the hopper.",
      "Monitor the consistency of the milled product at the discharge.",
      "Recirculate the product if additional homogenization is required.",
      "Monitor roller temperature to prevent product melting or degradation.",
      "After completion, stop the feed and allow the mill to run until empty.",
      "Dismantle product contact parts for thorough cleaning.",
      "Sanitize components and reassemble for next use.",
      "Document milling parameters and product characteristics in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Maintain proper gap settings to avoid metal-to-metal contact.",
      "Monitor product temperature continuously for heat-sensitive bases.",
      "Do not process materials containing abrasive particles that can damage rollers.",
      "Ensure proper cooling water flow during extended operations.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE including gloves and apron."
