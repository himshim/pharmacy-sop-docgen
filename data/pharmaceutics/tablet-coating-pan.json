    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Tablet Coating Pan for applying protective or functional coatings to tablets.",
    "scope": "Applicable to tablet processing activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the coating pan is clean and free from previous batch residues.",
      "Load the core tablets into the pan and start the rotation.",
      "Set the inlet air temperature and airflow as per the coating protocol.",
      "Prepare the coating suspension ensuring a homogeneous mixture.",
      "Install the spray gun and adjust the atomization pressure.",
      "Apply the coating suspension in a controlled manner while monitoring the bed temperature.",
      "Ensure continuous drying of tablets during the spray cycle.",
      "Continue until the desired weight gain or color intensity is achieved.",
      "Perform final drying and cooling of tablets before unloading.",
      "Clean the pan and spray assembly thoroughly after the process.",
      "Document all coating parameters and final yield."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Maintain consistent pan speed to ensure uniform coating.",
      "Avoid over-wetting the tablets to prevent sticking or twinning.",
      "Regularly check for nozzle blockage during the spray process.",
