    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Powder Flow Tester for assessing flow characteristics of pharmaceutical powders.",
    "scope": "Applicable to powder characterization activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the instrument is calibrated and placed on a level surface.",
      "Select the appropriate test cell or hopper based on sample type.",
      "Weigh and load the powder sample into the testing unit.",
      "Set test parameters: consolidation stress, shear rate, or flow time.",
      "Initiate the test through the control software or interface.",
      "Record flow parameters like Carr’s index, Hausner ratio, or flow rate.",
      "Repeat the test for multiple replicates to ensure reproducibility.",
      "Clean the sample cell and hopper thoroughly after each test.",
      "Document results and powder flow classification in the record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Handle powders carefully to avoid pre-compaction before testing.",
      "Ensure the sample is representative of the entire batch.",
      "Maintain consistent environmental conditions (temp/humidity).",
      "Clean the equipment between samples to prevent cross-contamination.",
      "Follow manufacturer instructions for specific shear cell assembly."
