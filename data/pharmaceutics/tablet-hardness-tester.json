    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Tablet Hardness Tester for measuring crushing strength.",
    "scope": "Applicable to tablet testing activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Verify the cleanliness of the testing platform and jaws.",
      "Place the tablet between the jaws of the hardness tester.",
      "Align the tablet correctly based on its shape (radial or longitudinal).",
      "Apply force gradually until the tablet breaks.",
      "Read the hardness value from the scale or digital display.",
      "Discard the tablet fragments and clean the platform.",
      "Repeat the procedure for at least 10 tablets per batch.",
      "Calculate the average hardness and check against specifications.",
      "Document all individual readings and the mean value."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid applying force too rapidly to ensure accurate readings.",
      "Always zero the instrument before starting a new set of tests.",
      "Clean the jaws regularly to remove accumulated dust.",
      "Handle the tablets with care to avoid pre-test damage.",
      "Perform regular calibration with standard weights."
