  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Ball Mill for size reduction and grinding of pharmaceutical materials into fine powder using grinding media.",
    "scope": "Applicable to milling and grinding activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the ball mill is placed on a stable foundation and properly leveled.",
      "Check that all safety guards and covers are properly secured.",
      "Verify that the mill jar or cylinder is clean, dry, and free from previous material.",
      "Select appropriate grinding media (balls) based on material hardness and desired fineness.",
      "Load the grinding balls into the mill jar (typically 30-50% of jar volume).",
      "Weigh the material to be milled and ensure it is pre-dried if necessary.",
      "Add the material to the mill jar (typically 20-30% of jar volume for optimal grinding).",
      "Secure the mill jar lid tightly and ensure proper sealing to prevent leakage.",
      "Mount the mill jar on the roller assembly or in the mill housing securely.",
      "Close all safety guards and ensure they are locked before operation.",
      "Set the rotation speed according to the material type and desired particle size.",
      "Set the milling time based on the hardness of material and required fineness.",
      "Start the ball mill and observe initial operation for any unusual noise or vibration.",
      "Allow milling to continue for the programmed duration without interruption.",
      "Monitor temperature periodically if heat-sensitive materials are being processed.",
      "After completion, stop the mill and wait for complete cessation of rotation.",
      "Open safety guards and carefully remove the mill jar.",
      "Open the jar lid and separate the milled powder from grinding balls using a sieve.",
      "Collect the milled powder and verify particle size if required.",
      "Clean the mill jar, grinding balls, and mill components thoroughly.",
      "Document milling parameters including time, speed, and material details in the record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never operate the mill without proper safety guards in place.",
      "Do not overload the mill jar beyond recommended capacity.",
      "Ensure proper ball-to-material ratio for efficient grinding.",
      "Avoid milling heat-sensitive materials for extended periods without cooling.",
      "Wear hearing protection as ball mills can generate significant noise.",
      "Do not open the mill or remove the jar while it is in motion.",
      "Check grinding media periodically for wear and replace if necessary.",
      "Ensure proper ventilation if milling materials that generate dust.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE including safety goggles, dust mask, and gloves.",
      "Follow electrical safety guidelines and ensure proper grounding."
