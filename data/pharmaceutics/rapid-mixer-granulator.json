    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Rapid Mixer Granulator (RMG) for high-shear wet granulation.",
    "scope": "Applicable to granulation activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check cleanliness of mixing bowl, impeller, and chopper.",
      "Verify safety interlocks and air pressure for seals.",
      "Load dry powders and perform dry mixing for specified time.",
      "Add binder solution at a controlled rate while impeller is running.",
      "Engage the chopper to break down large aggregates.",
      "Monitor the motor load or 'ampere' reading to determine endpoint.",
      "Stop the motor once granules with desired consistency are formed.",
      "Discharge wet granules through the discharge port immediately.",
      "Clean the bowl, blades, and discharge path thoroughly.",
      "Document all speeds, times, and binder quantities in the BMR."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never attempt to open the lid while the impeller is rotating.",
      "Ensure the discharge valve is properly sealed before starting.",
      "Monitor granulation endpoint closely to prevent over-granulation.",
      "Clean the chopper and impeller seals regularly to prevent leaks.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE for high-speed operation environment."
