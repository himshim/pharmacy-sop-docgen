    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Vibratory Sieve Shaker for precise particle size analysis.",
    "scope": "Applicable to powder analysis activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Select the required sieve stack and clean each sieve thoroughly.",
      "Place the sieves on the vibratory platform in descending order of mesh size.",
      "Weigh the sample and pour it onto the top sieve.",
      "Secure the stack with the clamping system.",
      "Set the vibration intensity (amplitude) and the timer.",
      "Start the shaker and allow it to run for the designated time.",
      "Once complete, remove the sieves and weigh the fractions retained.",
      "Analyze the data to determine the particle size distribution.",
      "Clean the sieves using an ultrasonic cleaner or soft brush.",
      "Document all results and sieve mesh details."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not exceed the maximum load capacity for each sieve.",
      "Ensure the clamping pressure is uniform to avoid uneven vibration.",
      "Monitor for unusual noise that may indicate loose parts.",
      "Avoid using sharp objects to clean the sieve mesh.",
      "Maintain the equipment in a dry environment to prevent corrosion."
