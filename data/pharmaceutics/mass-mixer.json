    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Mass Mixer for thorough mixing of pharmaceutical powders and wet mass preparation for various dosage forms.",
    "scope": "Applicable to mass mixing activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the mass mixer is installed on a stable surface in a clean area.",
      "Verify that the mixing bowl, blades, and lid are clean and properly assembled.",
      "Check electrical connections and safety interlocks.",
      "Weigh all ingredients accurately as per formulation.",
      "Load powder ingredients into the mixing bowl.",
      "Do not exceed maximum bowl capacity.",
      "Close the bowl lid securely.",
      "Set mixer speed to low initially for dry mixing.",
      "Start the mixer and allow powders to blend uniformly.",
      "Mix dry ingredients for specified time.",
      "If preparing wet mass, prepare binder or granulating fluid.",
      "Add liquid gradually while mixer is running.",
      "Increase mixer speed if necessary for proper wet massing.",
      "Monitor wet mass formation and consistency.",
      "Continue mixing until uniform wet mass is achieved.",
      "Check wet mass consistency by visual examination or squeeze test.",
      "Stop the mixer once endpoint is reached.",
      "Discharge wet mass through appropriate outlet.",
      "Clean the mixing bowl, blades, and all components immediately.",
      "Inspect for residue or product buildup.",
      "Document mixing time, liquid addition, and observations in the batch record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overload the mixer beyond rated capacity.",
      "Add liquids gradually to prevent over-wetting.",
      "Monitor mixing endpoint to achieve desired consistency.",
      "Discharge wet mass promptly to prevent drying.",
      "Clean equipment immediately after use.",
      "Ensure safety interlocks are functioning.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE including gloves and protective clothing.",
      "Follow lockout/tagout procedures during maintenance.",
      "Validate mixing parameters for consistent quality.",
      "Prevent cross-contamination through thorough cleaning."
