    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Disintegration Test Apparatus for determination of disintegration time of tablets and capsules as per pharmacopeial standards.",
    "scope": "Applicable to disintegration testing activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the disintegration apparatus is placed on a stable, level surface.",
      "Verify that the basket-rack assembly and tubes are clean and undamaged.",
      "Check that the heating element and temperature controller are functioning.",
      "Fill the disintegration vessel with appropriate disintegration medium (water, buffer, etc.).",
      "Fill medium to the specified level (typically 800-1000 mL).",
      "Set the temperature controller to 37 ± 0.5°C for standard testing.",
      "Allow the medium to reach and stabilize at the set temperature.",
      "Verify temperature using a calibrated thermometer.",
      "Take six tablets or capsules from the batch for testing.",
      "If specified, place a disc in each tube to prevent capsule floating.",
      "Place one tablet or capsule in each of the six tubes of the basket.",
      "Lower the basket-rack assembly into the disintegration medium.",
      "Ensure tablets or capsules are fully immersed in the medium.",
      "Start the timer and vertical reciprocating motion simultaneously.",
      "Set the stroke frequency to 29-32 cycles per minute.",
      "Observe the tablets or capsules during disintegration process.",
      "Note the time when all units have completely disintegrated.",
      "Complete disintegration means no residue remains on the screen or only soft mass remains.",
      "If any unit fails to disintegrate, repeat test with additional 6 units.",
      "Record disintegration time and compliance status.",
      "Remove basket assembly and clean thoroughly after testing.",
      "Document all observations, disintegration times, and results in the QC record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Maintain temperature at 37 ± 0.5°C throughout the test.",
      "Use appropriate disintegration medium as specified in monograph.",
      "Ensure proper stroke frequency for valid results.",
      "Do not disturb or manually break tablets during testing.",
      "Use discs appropriately for capsules to prevent floating.",
      "Check tubes for cracks or damage before use.",
      "Clean apparatus thoroughly between different products.",
      "Verify calibration of temperature controller regularly.",
      "Follow pharmacopeial specifications for testing conditions.",
      "Dispose of tested units and medium as per laboratory protocols."
