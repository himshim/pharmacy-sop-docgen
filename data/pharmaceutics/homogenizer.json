    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Homogenizer for uniform mixing and particle size reduction of pharmaceutical emulsions, suspensions, and dispersions using high-pressure homogenization.",
    "scope": "Applicable to homogenization activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the homogenizer is installed on a stable foundation with proper leveling.",
      "Verify that all piping connections, inlet, and outlet valves are secure.",
      "Check that homogenizing valve and impact ring are clean and properly assembled.",
      "Verify cooling water supply is connected and flowing if applicable.",
      "Power ON the homogenizer and check for proper operation.",
      "Set the homogenization pressure according to product requirements.",
      "Prepare product or coarse emulsion for homogenization.",
      "Prime the homogenizer by running water or solvent through the system.",
      "Drain priming liquid completely before introducing product.",
      "Start feeding product into the homogenizer inlet at controlled rate.",
      "Adjust feed rate to maintain desired pressure and flow.",
      "Monitor homogenization pressure continuously during operation.",
      "Collect homogenized product at the outlet in appropriate containers.",
      "Pass product through multiple cycles if required for finer particle size.",
      "Monitor product temperature and use cooling if necessary.",
      "Check particle size or droplet size periodically during processing.",
      "After completion, flush the system with water or appropriate solvent.",
      "Continue flushing until all product residue is removed.",
      "Disassemble homogenizing valve for thorough cleaning and inspection.",
      "Inspect valve seat and impact ring for wear and replace if necessary.",
      "Reassemble and sanitize the system if required for next batch.",
      "Document homogenization pressure, cycles, and product characteristics in the record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not exceed maximum operating pressure of the homogenizer.",
      "Ensure proper priming to avoid running the pump dry.",
      "Monitor product temperature to prevent heat-induced degradation.",
      "Use cooling system for prolonged operation or high-pressure processing.",
      "Avoid processing materials with large particles that can damage valve.",
      "Check valve components regularly for wear and replace when needed.",
      "Ensure proper feed rate to maintain stable pressure.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE including safety goggles and gloves.",
      "Follow lockout/tagout procedures during maintenance.",
      "Clean and sanitize thoroughly between different products."
