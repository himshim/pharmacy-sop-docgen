    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Rotary Tablet Press for high-speed compression of tablets.",
    "scope": "Applicable to tablet manufacturing activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure all punches and dies are clean, polished, and properly installed.",
      "Check safety interlocks, hopper level, and lubrication system.",
      "Set initial parameters: tablet weight, thickness, and hardness.",
      "Load granules into the hopper and start the machine at low speed.",
      "Perform initial sampling and check tablet characteristics (Wt, Hardness, Thickness).",
      "Adjust compression force and weight controls to meet specifications.",
      "Once parameters are stable, increase to production speed.",
      "Conduct in-process quality checks every 15-30 minutes.",
      "Collect compressed tablets in clean, labeled containers.",
      "After completion, stop the machine and unload remaining granules.",
      "Clean the punches, dies, and turret thoroughly as per cleaning SOP.",
      "Document all machine settings and yield in the BMR."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never place hands near the turret or punches while machine is running.",
      "Stop the machine immediately if unusual noise or vibration occurs.",
      "Ensure proper punch lubrication to prevent sticking/picking.",
      "Monitor tablet weight uniformity strictly during the run.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE and follow line clearance procedures."
