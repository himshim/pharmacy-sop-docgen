    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Pelletizer for production of uniform spherical pellets from wet masses.",
    "scope": "Applicable to pelletization activities carried out in the Pharmaceutics.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the pelletizer plate and chamber are clean and dry.",
      "Select and install the appropriate friction plate.",
      "Prepare wet mass with optimal moisture content for pelletization.",
      "Power ON the pelletizer and set the rotation speed.",
      "Load extrudates or wet mass into the rotating chamber.",
      "Monitor the rounding process and time carefully.",
      "Discharge the formed pellets once they reach desired sphericity.",
      "Clean the plate and chamber thoroughly to remove residues.",
      "Dry the pellets using appropriate drying equipment.",
      "Document pelletization speed, time, and yield in the batch record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid over-loading the chamber to maintain pellet quality.",
      "Control processing time to prevent pellet breakage or over-rounding.",
      "Ensure wet mass consistency is uniform across batches.",
      "Clean the friction plate promptly to prevent material buildup.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE including mask and gloves."
