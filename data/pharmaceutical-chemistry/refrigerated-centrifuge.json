    "purpose": "To separate samples at high speeds while maintaining a specific low temperature.",
    "scope": "Applicable to separation of heat-sensitive materials in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the centrifuge and set the desired temperature to allow pre-cooling.",
      "Load samples into tubes, ensuring they are balanced by weight (within 0.1g).",
      "Place tubes in the rotor in a symmetrical arrangement.",
      "Secure the rotor lid and close the main centrifuge cover.",
      "Set the speed (RPM/RCF) and time on the control panel.",
      "Start the run and monitor for any vibration or error codes.",
      "Once the rotor stops completely, remove the samples immediately.",
      "Wipe any condensation from the chamber before closing the lid for storage."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never operate the centrifuge with an unbalanced rotor.",
      "Ensure the rotor is properly seated and the lid is tightened.",
      "Do not exceed the maximum rated speed for the specific rotor being used.",
      "Clean any spills in the chamber immediately to prevent corrosion.",
      "Check the condition of the O-rings and seals regularly."
