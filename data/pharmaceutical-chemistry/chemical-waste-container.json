    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the collection and storage of general chemical waste.",
    "scope": "Applicable to waste disposal activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Select a waste container that is compatible with the chemical waste being generated.",
      "Ensure the container is properly labeled as 'HAZARDOUS WASTE' with a list of constituents.",
      "Keep the waste container in a designated satellite accumulation area (SAA).",
      "Add waste to the container using a funnel and close the cap immediately after each addition.",
      "Do not mix incompatible wastes (e.g., organics and oxidizers) in the same container.",
      "Monitor the container level; do not fill past 80-90% to prevent leaks or pressure build-up.",
      "Wipe any drips or spills on the outside of the container after use.",
      "Keep the container cap securely tightened when not actively adding waste.",
      "Arrange for disposal through the institutional waste management system once the container is full.",
      "Record all additions to the waste log including date, chemical names, and approximate volumes."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always verify chemical compatibility before adding to a waste container.",
      "Ensure the labeling is permanent and legible.",
      "Store waste containers in a secondary containment tray.",
      "Never leave a waste container open or unattended.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE when handling and transferring waste."
