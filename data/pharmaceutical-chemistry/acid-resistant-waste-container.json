    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the safe collection and temporary storage of acidic chemical waste.",
    "scope": "Applicable to waste management activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the waste container is made of appropriate acid-resistant material (e.g., HDPE or PTFE).",
      "Verify that the container is clearly labeled as 'ACIDIC WASTE' with hazardous symbols.",
      "Place the container in a secondary containment tray to capture potential leaks.",
      "Before adding waste, check the compatibility of the waste with the container material.",
      "Pour acidic waste slowly into the container using a funnel to avoid splashing.",
      "Do not mix incompatible acids or organic solvents in the same container.",
      "Keep the container tightly closed when not in use.",
      "Monitor the fill level and ensure the container is not filled beyond 80% capacity.",
      "Securely tighten the cap before transporting the container for final disposal.",
      "Record the type and volume of acid added to the waste log for each use.",
      "Inspect the container periodically for any signs of leakage, swelling, or degradation."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never mix acidic waste with cyanide or sulfide containing wastes as it may generate toxic gases.",
      "Always wear appropriate PPE including acid-resistant gloves and safety goggles.",
      "Do not overfill the container to allow for expansion.",
      "Keep waste containers away from heat sources and incompatible chemicals.",
      "Ensure the secondary containment is clean and dry."
