  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To provide safe and uniform heating for round-bottom flasks.",
    "scope": "Applicable to synthesis and distillation in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Select a heating mantle that matches the size of the flask being used.",
      "Inspect the fabric and heating element for any chemical spills or tears.",
      "Place the flask inside the mantle and secure it with a clamp.",
      "Connect the mantle to a variable voltage transformer (Variac) or controller.",
      "Gradually increase the voltage to reach the desired temperature.",
      "Monitor the temperature using a thermometer placed inside the flask.",
      "Turn OFF the controller and allow the mantle to cool before removing the flask.",
      "Clean any spills on the mantle surface only after it has cooled completely."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never plug a heating mantle directly into a wall outlet without a controller.",
      "Do not use the mantle if the fabric is wet with water or solvents.",
      "Ensure the flask is in direct contact with the mantle surface for efficient heating.",
      "Avoid heating the mantle above its rated temperature.",
      "Always use a stir bar or boiling chips to prevent bumping."
