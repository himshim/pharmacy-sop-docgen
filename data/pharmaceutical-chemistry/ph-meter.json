    "purpose": "To measure the acidity or alkalinity of aqueous solutions accurately.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical tasks in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Turn ON the pH meter and allow it to warm up for 10 minutes.",
      "Rinse the electrode with distilled water and blot dry gently.",
      "Perform a two-point calibration using standard buffer solutions (e.g., pH 4 and 7).",
      "Immerse the electrode in the sample solution and stir gently.",
      "Wait for the stability icon or beep before recording the pH value.",
      "Rinse the electrode thoroughly after use and store in 3M KCl solution.",
      "Document the calibration and sample readings in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not touch the glass bulb of the electrode with your fingers.",
      "Ensure the electrode never dries out during storage.",
      "Clean the electrode with an appropriate solution if it becomes sluggish.",
      "Always use fresh buffer solutions for calibration.",
      "Allow solutions to reach room temperature for more accurate readings."
