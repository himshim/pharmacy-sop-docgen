  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To provide high-temperature heating for ashing, combustion, and ignition of pharmaceutical samples.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical chemistry procedures in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the furnace interior is clean and free from residues.",
      "Place the sample in a suitable silica or porcelain crucible.",
      "Set the desired temperature and ramp rate on the digital controller.",
      "Slowly open the heavy furnace door and place the crucible inside.",
      "Close the door and start the heating cycle.",
      "Monitor the temperature display to ensure it follows the set profile.",
      "Once the heating time is complete, turn OFF the heating element.",
      "Allow the furnace to cool to a safe temperature (typically <200°C) before opening.",
      "Use long-handled tongs to remove the crucible.",
      "Record the final weight or observations after cooling the crucible in a desiccator."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always wear heat-resistant gloves and eye protection when opening the door.",
      "Do not place flammable or explosive materials in the furnace.",
      "Ensure the furnace is placed on a non-combustible surface with proper ventilation.",
      "Avoid thermal shock by not opening the door at very high temperatures.",
      "Regularly inspect the heating elements and thermocouple for damage."
