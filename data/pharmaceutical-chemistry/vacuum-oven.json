    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for drying heat-sensitive or oxygen-sensitive materials under vacuum.",
    "scope": "Applicable to sample drying in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the sample on a tray and slide it into the oven chamber.",
      "Close the door and tighten the latches to ensure an airtight seal.",
      "Connect the vacuum pump and turn it ON.",
      "Slowly open the vacuum valve and monitor the pressure gauge.",
      "Once the vacuum is established, set the required temperature on the controller.",
      "After drying is complete, turn OFF the heater and allow the chamber to cool.",
      "Slowly bleed air or nitrogen into the chamber through the vent valve.",
      "Open the door and remove the sample."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never exceed the maximum temperature rating of the oven.",
      "Ensure the door gasket is clean and free from debris to maintain a seal.",
      "Bleed the vacuum very slowly to avoid sample dispersion.",
      "Do not dry materials that may release explosive or highly corrosive vapors.",
      "Regularly check the vacuum pump oil level and performance."
