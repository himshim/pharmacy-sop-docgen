    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for temperature measurement using a digital thermometer.",
    "scope": "Applicable to laboratory activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Power ON the digital thermometer and check the display.",
      "Clean the probe with distilled water or a suitable disinfectant (e.g., alcohol swab).",
      "Insert the probe into the medium (liquid, gas, or solid) to be measured.",
      "Ensure the probe is immersed to the correct depth for an accurate reading.",
      "Wait for the digital reading to stabilize (usually signaled by a beep or stability icon).",
      "Note the temperature reading in the logbook or batch record.",
      "Remove the probe and clean it thoroughly before storing.",
      "Switch OFF the thermometer to conserve battery power."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not exceed the temperature range specified for the probe.",
      "Avoid bending or pulling the probe cable excessively.",
      "Protect the digital display unit from moisture and extreme heat.",
      "Regularly check the accuracy against a calibrated reference thermometer.",
      "Replace batteries when the display becomes dim or shows an error."
