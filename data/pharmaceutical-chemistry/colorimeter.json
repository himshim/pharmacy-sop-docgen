    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the measurement of absorbance and concentration of colored solutions using a colorimeter.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the colorimeter and allow it to warm up for at least 15 minutes.",
      "Select the appropriate filter or wavelength corresponding to the maximum absorbance of the sample.",
      "Fill a clean cuvette with the blank solution (solvent) up to the mark.",
      "Wipe the outer surface of the cuvette with a lint-free tissue.",
      "Insert the blank cuvette into the sample holder and adjust the instrument to zero absorbance or 100% transmittance.",
      "Replace the blank with a cuvette containing the standard or sample solution.",
      "Record the absorbance or transmittance reading displayed on the screen.",
      "Repeat the measurement for all standards to construct a calibration curve if necessary.",
      "Note the readings for unknown samples and calculate the concentration using the calibration curve.",
      "Clean the cuvettes thoroughly after use and switch OFF the instrument."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always handle cuvettes by the frosted sides to avoid fingerprints on the optical path.",
      "Ensure there are no air bubbles in the solution inside the cuvette.",
      "Use matched cuvettes for blank and sample measurements for better accuracy.",
      "Do not use cuvettes with scratches on the optical surface.",
      "Maintain a consistent orientation of the cuvette in the sample holder."
