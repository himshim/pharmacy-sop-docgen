  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To provide accurate weighing of materials with a readability of 0.001g to 0.01g.",
    "scope": "Applicable to general laboratory weighing in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check the level of the balance and adjust the feet if necessary.",
      "Power ON the balance and wait for the zero display to stabilize.",
      "Place a weighing boat on the pan and press the 'TARE' button.",
      "Add the sample gradually until the required weight is reached.",
      "Record the weight once the stability indicator appears.",
      "Remove the sample and clean the weighing pan with a soft brush.",
      "Turn OFF the balance or leave in standby as per laboratory protocol."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid placing the balance near air vents or vibrating equipment.",
      "Do not exceed the maximum weighing capacity listed on the instrument.",
      "Use weighing paper or boats; never place chemicals directly on the pan.",
      "Close the draft shield (if present) to prevent air currents from affecting the reading.",
      "Perform a calibration check weekly using standard weights."
