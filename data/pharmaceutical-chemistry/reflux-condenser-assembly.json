  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To provide continuous heating of reaction mixtures without loss of solvent.",
    "scope": "Applicable to synthesis in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Assemble the round-bottom flask, condenser, and heating mantle.",
      "Apply a thin layer of grease to the ground-glass joints.",
      "Connect the water inlet (bottom) and outlet (top) to the condenser.",
      "Turn ON the cooling water and ensure a steady flow.",
      "Add reaction mixture and boiling chips to the flask.",
      "Turn ON the heat and monitor the reflux rate (1-2 drops per second).",
      "After the reaction is complete, turn OFF the heat and allow the flask to cool.",
      "Turn OFF the cooling water and dismantle the assembly for cleaning."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never heat a closed system; ensure the top of the condenser is open or fitted with a drying tube.",
      "Ensure the water flow is consistent to prevent solvent vapors from escaping.",
      "Secure all joints with Keck clips to prevent accidental disconnection.",
      "Handle hot glassware with appropriate heat-resistant gloves.",
      "Check for leaks in the water tubing before starting the reaction."
