    "title": "Operation of Hot Plate with Magnetic Stirrer"
  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To provide simultaneous heating and stirring of liquid mixtures.",
    "scope": "Applicable to synthesis and dissolution in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the beaker or flask on the center of the hot plate.",
      "Add a clean magnetic stir bar (flea) into the container.",
      "Power ON the unit and adjust the stirring speed to create a gentle vortex.",
      "Adjust the temperature dial to the desired heating level.",
      "Monitor the process and adjust parameters as the viscosity changes.",
      "Turn OFF both heating and stirring dials after the task.",
      "Remove the stir bar using a magnetic retriever (wand).",
      "Clean the plate and stir bar thoroughly after they have cooled."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the stir bar size is appropriate for the volume and container.",
      "Do not exceed the stirring speed that causes the bar to 'jump' or decouple.",
      "Keep the unit away from strong external magnetic fields.",
      "Always check the glass container for cracks before heating.",
      "Wear PPE to protect against splashes from the rotating liquid."
