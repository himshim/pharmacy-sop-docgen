    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for rapid separation of solids from liquids using vacuum-assisted filtration.",
    "scope": "Applicable to separation processes in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Assemble the filter base on the collection flask and attach the vacuum hose.",
      "Place the appropriate filter membrane (e.g., Nylon, PTFE) on the support screen.",
      "Place the funnel on top and secure it with the clamp mechanism.",
      "Moisten the membrane with a few drops of the solvent to be filtered.",
      "Switch ON the vacuum pump.",
      "Pour the sample slowly into the funnel.",
      "Once filtration is complete, disconnect the vacuum source first, then turn OFF the pump.",
      "Remove the funnel and retrieve the filter or filtrate as required."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the membrane is perfectly centered to prevent bypass.",
      "Do not use membranes that are incompatible with the solvent.",
      "Always release the vacuum before stopping the pump to prevent back-pressure.",
      "Use thick-walled suction flasks to prevent implosion.",
      "Clean all components of the assembly thoroughly after each use."
