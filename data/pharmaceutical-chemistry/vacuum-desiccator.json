  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for drying samples or storing moisture-sensitive materials under reduced pressure.",
    "scope": "Applicable to sample preservation in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the desiccant is active (indicated by its color).",
      "Apply a thin layer of vacuum grease to the ground-glass flange.",
      "Place the sample on the support plate inside the desiccator.",
      "Slide the lid into position to create an initial seal.",
      "Connect the vacuum pump to the valve on the lid using heavy-walled tubing.",
      "Slowly open the valve and turn ON the vacuum pump.",
      "Once the desired vacuum is reached, close the valve and turn OFF the pump.",
      "To open, slowly turn the valve to allow air to enter the chamber before sliding off the lid."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always check for cracks or deep scratches in the glass before applying vacuum.",
      "Release the vacuum slowly to avoid a sudden rush of air disturbing the sample.",
      "Use a safety shield or enclosure to protect against potential implosion.",
      "Do not lift the desiccator by the lid handle when under vacuum.",
      "Ensure the stopcock is securely seated and greased."
