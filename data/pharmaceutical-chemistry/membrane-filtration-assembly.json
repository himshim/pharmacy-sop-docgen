    "purpose": "To remove particulate matter or microorganisms from liquids using membrane filters.",
    "scope": "Applicable to sample preparation and sterilization in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the base of the filtration unit on the collection flask and connect the vacuum.",
      "Using tweezers, place a membrane filter of the required pore size (e.g., 0.22µm or 0.45µm) on the support screen.",
      "Place the funnel on top and secure it with a clamp or magnetic lock.",
      "Pour the liquid sample into the funnel.",
      "Apply vacuum slowly until the filtration is complete.",
      "Release the vacuum and carefully remove the funnel.",
      "Transfer the filtrate to a sterile or clean container as required.",
      "Dispose of the used membrane filter and clean the assembly."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always use tweezers to handle membrane filters to avoid contamination.",
      "Ensure the membrane filter is compatible with the solvent being filtered.",
      "Check for any tears or damage to the membrane before use.",
      "Do not apply excessive vacuum that could rupture the membrane.",
      "Rinse the assembly with distilled water between different samples."
