    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the measurement of pH using a digital pH meter.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the pH meter and allow it to warm up for 10-15 minutes.",
      "Rinse the pH electrode with distilled water and blot dry with a soft tissue.",
      "Perform a two or three-point calibration using standard buffer solutions (e.g., pH 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0).",
      "Ensure the temperature compensation is either automatic or set to the solution temperature.",
      "Immerse the electrode into the sample solution and stir gently.",
      "Wait for the 'STABLE' indicator to appear on the display.",
      "Record the pH value and temperature of the solution.",
      "Rinse the electrode thoroughly with distilled water after each measurement.",
      "Store the electrode in the recommended storage solution (usually 3M KCl).",
      "Document the calibration and measurement results in the analytical record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never let the pH electrode dry out; always keep it in storage solution.",
      "Handle the glass bulb of the electrode with extreme care.",
      "Calibrate the instrument at the beginning of each day or shift.",
      "Avoid cross-contamination by rinsing the electrode between samples.",
      "Do not use the electrode in solutions containing strong acids/bases for prolonged periods."
