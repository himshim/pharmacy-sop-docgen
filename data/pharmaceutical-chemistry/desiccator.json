  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the use of a desiccator to maintain a dry environment for samples.",
    "scope": "Applicable to sample preservation activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check that the desiccant (e.g., silica gel) at the bottom is fresh (indicated by blue color).",
      "If the silica gel has turned pink, regenerate it by heating in an oven or replace it.",
      "Apply a thin layer of vacuum grease to the ground-glass rim of the desiccator base.",
      "Place the sample (usually in a weighing boat or crucible) on the ceramic plate inside.",
      "Slide the lid onto the desiccator base to create an airtight seal; do not lift the lid directly.",
      "Allow the sample to reach equilibrium in the dry environment.",
      "When removing a sample, slide the lid off carefully to avoid disturbing the contents.",
      "Ensure the lid is replaced promptly after each use.",
      "Periodically clean the interior of the desiccator and renew the grease on the rim."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not place very hot crucibles directly in the desiccator; allow them to cool slightly first.",
      "Handle the desiccator with both hands, especially when moving it.",
      "Ensure the desiccant does not touch the sample plate.",
      "Avoid dropping the lid as it is made of heavy glass and can shatter.",
      "Use caution when sliding the lid to avoid trapping fingers."
