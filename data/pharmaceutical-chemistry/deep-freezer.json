    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the storage of chemicals and samples in a deep freezer.",
    "scope": "Applicable to storage activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the freezer is connected to a stabilized power supply.",
      "Set the thermostat to the required temperature (typically -20°C to -80°C).",
      "Allow the freezer to stabilize at the set temperature before loading samples.",
      "Organize samples in labeled racks or boxes for easy retrieval.",
      "Ensure all sample containers are tightly sealed and properly labeled.",
      "Keep a detailed log of the samples stored, including the date and position.",
      "Monitor and record the temperature daily from the digital display.",
      "Inspect the door gasket for ice build-up and defrost manually if necessary.",
      "Clean the interior periodically with an appropriate disinfectant/cleaner.",
      "Document any temperature excursions and corrective actions taken."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Minimize the duration and frequency of door openings to maintain temperature.",
      "Do not store food or beverages in the laboratory freezer.",
      "Ensure there is a backup power supply for critical samples.",
      "Wear insulated gloves when handling samples from the deep freezer.",
      "Report any persistent temperature deviations to the lab manager immediately."
