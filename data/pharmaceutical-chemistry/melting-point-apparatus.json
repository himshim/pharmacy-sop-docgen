  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To determine the melting point of a solid substance using a manual heating block and thermometer.",
    "scope": "Applicable to identity testing in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fill a capillary tube with a finely ground sample to a height of 2-3 mm.",
      "Insert the capillary into the heating block slot.",
      "Place a calibrated thermometer into the thermometer well.",
      "Switch ON the apparatus and set a rapid heating rate until 10-15°C below the expected MP.",
      "Reduce the heating rate to 1-2°C per minute near the melting point.",
      "Observe the sample through the magnifying lens and note the temperature when melting begins.",
      "Note the temperature when the entire sample has liquefied.",
      "Record the melting range (T1 - T2) in the logbook.",
      "Turn OFF the apparatus and allow it to cool."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not re-use a capillary tube for a second determination.",
      "Ensure the sample is dry, as moisture can depress the melting point.",
      "Pack the sample tightly at the bottom of the capillary to avoid air gaps.",
      "Handle the hot block with caution to prevent burns.",
      "Perform a calibration check with a known standard periodically."
