  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To measure the relative humidity and ambient temperature in the laboratory.",
    "scope": "Applicable to environmental monitoring in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the hygrometer in a location representative of the room environment.",
      "Ensure the sensor is not obstructed by equipment or furniture.",
      "Allow the device to stabilize for at least 30 minutes before taking a reading.",
      "Read the relative humidity (%) and temperature (°C) from the display.",
      "Record the values in the daily environmental logbook.",
      "Compare the readings with the specified limits for the laboratory.",
      "Report any deviations from the humidity range (typically 40-60%) to the supervisor."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not place the hygrometer near humidifiers or air conditioners.",
      "Avoid exposing the sensor to chemical fumes or extreme dust.",
      "Verify the accuracy of the hygrometer annually with a certified reference.",
      "Replace batteries as soon as the display becomes faint.",
      "Handle the device with care to prevent mechanical shock."
