    "purpose": "To provide a circular shaking motion for mixing samples in flasks or tubes.",
    "scope": "Applicable to extraction and mixing in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the flasks or containers securely in the clamps on the shaker platform.",
      "Ensure the load is balanced to prevent excessive vibration.",
      "Switch ON the power and set the required speed (RPM) and timer.",
      "Gradually increase the speed to the desired level.",
      "Observe the mixing action to ensure it is effective without splashing.",
      "The shaker will stop automatically if a timer is set.",
      "Turn OFF the power before removing the containers.",
      "Clean the platform surface of any drips or spills."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not exceed the maximum weight capacity of the shaker platform.",
      "Ensure all clamps are tightened properly before starting rotation.",
      "Check for loose parts or unusual noises during operation.",
      "Avoid placing the shaker near the edge of the lab bench.",
      "Do not use containers that are too tall or unstable for the platform."
