    "purpose": "To efficiently remove solvents from samples under reduced pressure and controlled heating.",
    "scope": "Applicable to solvent recovery and concentration in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fill the water bath and set it to the desired temperature.",
      "Attach the flask containing the sample to the bump bulb using a clip.",
      "Turn ON the cooling water for the condenser.",
      "Start the rotation of the flask at a moderate speed.",
      "Slowly turn ON the vacuum pump and adjust the vacuum level.",
      "Lower the rotating flask into the heated water bath.",
      "Monitor the distillation; once the solvent is removed, raise the flask.",
      "Release the vacuum first, then stop the rotation and heating.",
      "Remove the flask and collect the concentrated sample.",
      "Empty the solvent collection flask and clean the assembly."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always check the glassware for cracks before applying vacuum.",
      "Ensure the bump bulb is clean to prevent sample contamination.",
      "Do not fill the evaporating flask more than half full.",
      "Monitor the bath temperature to prevent thermal degradation of the sample.",
      "Wear safety goggles to protect against potential glass implosions."
