    "purpose": "To dry moist solids or evaporate solvents on a flat heated surface.",
    "scope": "Applicable to sample preparation in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Spread the moist material in a thin layer on a flat-bottomed glass dish.",
      "Place the dish on the hot plate and set a low heat setting.",
      "Stir the material periodically with a glass rod to ensure uniform drying.",
      "Observe for color changes or charring, especially for organic compounds.",
      "Once dried, remove the dish and allow it to cool in a desiccator.",
      "Clean the hot plate surface and the dish after use.",
      "Document the drying temperature and time."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use a low temperature setting to prevent decomposition of the sample.",
      "Work inside a fume hood if the drying process releases vapors.",
      "Handle hot dishes using appropriate tongs or gloves.",
      "Ensure the hot plate is level to prevent spills.",
      "Avoid using the dryer for highly volatile or explosive materials."
