    "purpose": "To mix large volumes or high-viscosity liquids using a top-mounted motor.",
    "scope": "Applicable to synthesis and formulation in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Mount the stirrer motor to a stable support stand.",
      "Attach the stirring paddle or impeller to the chuck and tighten.",
      "Insert the paddle into the liquid and ensure it is centered.",
      "Switch ON the motor and slowly increase the rotation speed.",
      "Adjust the height of the impeller if necessary for optimal mixing.",
      "Once mixing is complete, turn OFF the motor and wait for it to stop.",
      "Raise the motor assembly and remove the paddle for cleaning.",
      "Wipe the motor housing to remove any chemical dust or splashes."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the chuck is securely tightened to prevent the paddle from falling.",
      "Do not wear loose clothing or jewelry that could get caught in the rotating shaft.",
      "Use a safety shield if mixing hazardous or reactive materials.",
      "Monitor for motor overheating during prolonged use with viscous liquids.",
      "Ensure the vessel is properly secured to prevent movement during stirring."
