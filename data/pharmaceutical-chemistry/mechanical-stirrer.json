  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To mix high-viscosity liquids or large volumes using a motor-driven impeller.",
    "scope": "Applicable to pilot-scale synthesis in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Secure the stirrer motor to a stable laboratory stand using a boss-head.",
      "Attach the stirring shaft and impeller, ensuring they are tightly fastened.",
      "Lower the assembly into the reaction flask and center the shaft.",
      "Ensure the impeller is at the correct height within the liquid.",
      "Switch ON the motor and slowly increase the speed (RPM).",
      "Adjust the torque and speed as the reaction mixture changes consistency.",
      "Turn OFF the motor and raise the stirrer head before removing the flask.",
      "Clean the impeller and shaft thoroughly with appropriate solvents."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the stirrer is properly grounded to prevent electrical hazards.",
      "Do not touch the rotating shaft or impeller during operation.",
      "Check for excessive vibration and tighten all clamps if necessary.",
      "Use a lubricant or seal (like a PTFE sleeve) for stirred reactions under reflux.",
      "Wear protective clothing to guard against potential splashes."
