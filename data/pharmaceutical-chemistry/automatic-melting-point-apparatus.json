  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the determination of melting point of chemical substances using an automatic apparatus.",
    "scope": "Applicable to characterization activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the apparatus is clean and the heating block is free from residues.",
      "Power ON the instrument and allow it to perform self-diagnostic tests.",
      "Prepare the sample by grinding to a fine powder and filling into a capillary tube.",
      "Pack the powder to a height of 2-3 mm at the bottom of the capillary.",
      "Select the appropriate heating program (start temp, ramp rate, and stop temp).",
      "Insert the capillary tube into the designated slot in the heating block.",
      "Start the measurement; the instrument will automatically detect and record the melting range.",
      "Observe the sample through the viewing lens if manual verification is required.",
      "Note the melting point or range displayed on the digital screen after completion.",
      "Wait for the heating block to cool down to a safe temperature before removing the capillary.",
      "Discard the used capillary tube and clean the sample area.",
      "Document the results and the specific heating parameters used in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the sample is dry and finely powdered for accurate results.",
      "Avoid air gaps in the capillary tube by proper tapping/packing.",
      "Do not use a high ramp rate (typically <1°C/min) near the expected melting point.",
      "Wear safety glasses when working near the heating block.",
      "Handle hot components with caution to avoid thermal burns."
