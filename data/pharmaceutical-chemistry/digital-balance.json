    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for general weighing using a digital balance.",
    "scope": "Applicable to laboratory activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the balance on a flat, stable surface away from air drafts.",
      "Check the level of the balance and adjust if necessary.",
      "Power ON the balance and wait for the zero reading to stabilize.",
      "Calibrate the balance using standard weights if required by the SOP.",
      "Place the weighing container on the pan and press 'TARE'.",
      "Carefully add the material to be weighed until the desired weight is achieved.",
      "Note the weight reading and remove the container.",
      "Clean the weighing pan and the surrounding area with a soft brush.",
      "Turn OFF the balance after completing the weighing tasks."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not exceed the weighing capacity of the balance.",
      "Always use a weighing boat or paper; do not place chemicals directly on the pan.",
      "Protect the balance from dust and chemical spills.",
      "Avoid placing the balance near sources of heat or electronic interference.",
      "Ensure the pan is empty when the balance is switched ON."
