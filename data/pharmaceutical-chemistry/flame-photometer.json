    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the quantitative analysis of alkali and alkaline earth metals.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical activities carried out in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the instrument and allow it to warm up for 15 minutes.",
      "Connect the gas supply and air compressor, then ignite the flame.",
      "Adjust the air and gas pressure to obtain a stable blue flame.",
      "Aspirate distilled water to clean the nebulizer and zero the instrument.",
      "Aspirate standard solutions of known concentrations (e.g., Na, K, Ca) to calibrate.",
      "Set the filter corresponding to the element being analyzed.",
      "Aspirate the sample solution and record the emission intensity displayed.",
      "Construct a calibration curve and determine the sample concentration.",
      "Aspirate distilled water for 5 minutes after use to flush the system.",
      "Turn OFF the gas supply first, followed by the air compressor and instrument."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the gas cylinders are stored safely and checked for leaks.",
      "Avoid using high concentrations of samples that could clog the nebulizer.",
      "Always work in a well-ventilated area due to the open flame.",
      "Handle standard solutions carefully to avoid contamination.",
      "Clean the nebulizer capillary regularly with a fine cleaning wire."
