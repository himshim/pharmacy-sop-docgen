    "purpose": "To measure the refractive index of liquids for identification and purity checks.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical testing in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Clean the prism surface with alcohol and a soft tissue.",
      "Place 1-2 drops of the sample liquid onto the prism.",
      "Close the prism cover and wait a few moments for temperature equilibration.",
      "Look through the eyepiece and adjust the control to align the boundary line with the crosshairs.",
      "Read the refractive index value from the scale or digital screen.",
      "Clean the prism immediately after use to prevent etching or residue build-up.",
      "Calibrate the instrument using distilled water (RI = 1.3330 at 20°C)."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not use abrasive materials to clean the delicate prism surface.",
      "Avoid using the refractometer for corrosive or highly acidic samples without checking compatibility.",
      "Perform measurements at the specified temperature (typically 20°C or 25°C).",
      "Ensure the light source is adequate for a clear boundary line.",
      "Store the instrument in its case when not in use."
