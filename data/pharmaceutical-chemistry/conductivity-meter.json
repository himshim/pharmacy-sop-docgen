    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the measurement of electrolytic conductivity of solutions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Connect the conductivity probe to the meter and power ON the instrument.",
      "Calibrate the meter using a standard conductivity solution (e.g., 0.01M KCl).",
      "Rinse the conductivity probe with distilled water and blot dry with a soft tissue.",
      "Immerse the probe into the sample solution ensuring the sensor is fully covered.",
      "Stir the solution gently to ensure homogeneity and wait for the reading to stabilize.",
      "Record the conductivity value and the temperature displayed on the meter.",
      "Rinse the probe thoroughly with distilled water after each measurement.",
      "Store the conductivity probe in the recommended storage solution or dry as per manufacturer instructions.",
      "Switch OFF the meter after completing the measurements."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid touching the electrode surface with fingers.",
      "Ensure there are no air bubbles trapped inside the electrode sensing area.",
      "Perform calibration regularly to ensure measurement accuracy.",
      "Rinse the probe between different samples to prevent cross-contamination.",
      "Do not use the probe in solutions that may damage the sensor (e.g., strong solvents)."
