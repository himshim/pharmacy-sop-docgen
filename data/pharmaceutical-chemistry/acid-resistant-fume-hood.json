    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Acid Resistant Fume Hood for safe handling of corrosive acids and hazardous chemical reactions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to chemical synthesis activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Verify that the fume hood exhaust fan is operational and the certification is current.",
      "Inspect the acid-resistant interior lining for any signs of damage or corrosion.",
      "Turn ON the exhaust system and allow it to run for at least 5 minutes before starting work.",
      "Verify face velocity using the built-in monitor (typically 80-120 fpm).",
      "Position the sash at the correct working height (usually indicated by an arrow).",
      "Place acid containers and reaction assemblies at least 6 inches inside the hood.",
      "Avoid blocking the rear baffles to ensure efficient air flow.",
      "Perform all acid transfers and reactions with the sash at the lowest practical height.",
      "In case of minor acid spills, neutralize immediately using appropriate neutralizing agents.",
      "After completion of work, allow the hood to run for 10 minutes to clear residual vapors.",
      "Clean the work surface thoroughly with water and wipe dry.",
      "Lower the sash completely when the hood is not in use.",
      "Document hood usage and any maintenance needs in the logbook."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always work with the sash at the lowest possible position for maximum protection.",
      "Do not store large quantities of acids inside the fume hood.",
      "Avoid rapid movements in front of the hood that could disrupt the air curtain.",
      "Ensure all acid containers are properly capped when not in use.",
      "Wear appropriate acid-resistant PPE including apron, gloves, and face shield."
