  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To provide precise temperature control for incubation of samples in tubes or flasks.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analytical and biochemical assays in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fill the bath with distilled water up to the marked level.",
      "Switch ON the power and set the required temperature on the controller.",
      "Allow the water to reach the set temperature and stabilize.",
      "Place the sample tubes in a rack and immerse the rack in the water.",
      "Ensure the water level is above the liquid level inside the tubes.",
      "Cover the bath with the lid to maintain temperature and prevent evaporation.",
      "Once the incubation is complete, remove the samples and turn OFF the bath.",
      "Drain and clean the bath regularly to prevent microbial growth."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never operate the water bath without water, as it will damage the heater.",
      "Do not use the bath for temperatures near or above the boiling point of water.",
      "Avoid splashes on the control panel or electrical components.",
      "Use distilled water to prevent scale build-up on the heating elements.",
      "Wear gloves when handling samples that may have leaked into the water."
