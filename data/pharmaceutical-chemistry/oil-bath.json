    "purpose": "To provide uniform heating for reaction flasks at temperatures above 100°C.",
    "scope": "Applicable to chemical synthesis in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check the oil level in the bath (typically silicone oil or paraffin oil).",
      "Ensure the exterior of the reaction flask is dry before immersion.",
      "Secure the flask using a clamp and lower it into the oil.",
      "Place a thermometer in the oil to monitor its temperature.",
      "Turn ON the heating element and adjust the temperature setting.",
      "Use a stir bar in the bath if the unit has a built-in stirrer for uniformity.",
      "After use, turn OFF the heat and allow the oil to cool before removing the flask.",
      "Wipe the oil off the flask carefully using a dry tissue or cloth."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not allow water to enter the hot oil, as it may cause splattering.",
      "Never exceed the flash point of the oil being used.",
      "Avoid moving the bath while the oil is hot.",
      "Ensure the electrical cord is kept away from the hot oil surface.",
      "Use a splash guard if the reaction involves volatile or reactive reagents."
