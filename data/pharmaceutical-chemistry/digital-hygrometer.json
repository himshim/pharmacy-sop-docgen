    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for monitoring humidity and temperature using a digital hygrometer.",
    "scope": "Applicable to environmental monitoring activities in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the digital hygrometer in the area where environmental monitoring is required.",
      "Ensure the batteries are fresh and the display is clear.",
      "Allow the instrument to equilibrate with the environment for at least 15 minutes.",
      "Read the current relative humidity (%) and temperature (°C) from the screen.",
      "Note the maximum and minimum readings if the instrument has a memory function.",
      "Reset the Min/Max values daily after recording the observations in the logbook.",
      "Check the calibration status of the hygrometer periodically against a reference standard.",
      "Clean the casing of the instrument with a dry, soft cloth."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not expose the hygrometer to direct sunlight or moisture.",
      "Avoid placing the instrument near heat sources or air conditioning vents.",
      "Do not touch the internal sensor components.",
      "Replace batteries promptly when the low-battery indicator appears.",
      "Ensure the instrument is used within its specified operating range."
