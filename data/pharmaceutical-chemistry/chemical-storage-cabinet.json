    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the safe storage and organization of chemicals in a dedicated storage cabinet.",
    "scope": "Applicable to inventory and safety activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the cabinet is made of material compatible with the chemicals stored (e.g., metal for flammables, plastic for corrosives).",
      "Group chemicals according to their compatibility and hazard classification (e.g., acids, bases, oxidizers).",
      "Verify that all containers are tightly closed and clearly labeled with chemical name and hazard warnings.",
      "Place larger and heavier containers on the bottom shelves.",
      "Ensure that liquid chemicals are stored in secondary containment trays.",
      "Maintain a current inventory list on the exterior of the cabinet.",
      "Keep the cabinet doors closed and locked when not in use.",
      "Check for any leaking containers or signs of crystallization/degradation regularly.",
      "Ensure the ventilation ports of the cabinet (if any) are not blocked.",
      "In case of a spill inside the cabinet, clean it immediately using the spill kit.",
      "Document the removal and return of chemicals in the inventory log."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never store incompatible chemicals (e.g., acids and bases) in the same cabinet section.",
      "Avoid overcrowding the shelves to prevent accidental breakage.",
      "Do not store flammables in a standard cabinet; use a certified flammable storage cabinet.",
      "Keep highly toxic or regulated substances in a separate, locked compartment.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE when retrieving or storing chemicals."
