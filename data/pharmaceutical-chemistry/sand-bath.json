    "purpose": "To provide high-temperature, uniform heating for reaction vessels using sand as a medium.",
    "scope": "Applicable to chemical synthesis in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fill a metal or heavy glass container with clean, dry sand.",
      "Place the container on a hot plate or heating mantle.",
      "Embed the reaction flask into the sand, ensuring it is well-supported.",
      "Place a thermometer in the sand near the flask to monitor temperature.",
      "Switch ON the heat and gradually reach the desired temperature.",
      "After use, turn OFF the heat and allow the sand to cool completely.",
      "Carefully remove the flask and wipe off any adhering sand particles."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the sand is completely dry to prevent steam pockets and splattering.",
      "Do not touch the hot sand with bare hands; use tools or gloves.",
      "Avoid overloading the hot plate with a heavy sand bath.",
      "Use a lid if the reaction involves volatile components to maintain heat.",
      "Regularly replace the sand if it becomes contaminated with chemical spills."
