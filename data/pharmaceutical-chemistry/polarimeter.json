    "purpose": "To measure the angle of rotation of polarized light through optically active substances.",
    "scope": "Applicable to identity and purity testing in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the light source (sodium lamp) and allow it to stabilize for 20 minutes.",
      "Fill the polarimeter tube with the solvent (blank) ensuring no air bubbles are trapped.",
      "Place the tube in the sample compartment and zero the instrument.",
      "Replace the blank with the sample solution prepared at a specific concentration.",
      "Rotate the analyzer until the two halves of the field are equally dark (manual) or read the digital display.",
      "Record the observed rotation (α) and the temperature.",
      "Calculate the specific optical rotation using the standard formula.",
      "Clean the polarimeter tube thoroughly after use with distilled water and solvent."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the polarimeter tube windows are clean and free from scratches.",
      "Strictly avoid air bubbles in the light path as they distort readings.",
      "Perform measurements at the temperature specified in the pharmacopoeia (usually 25°C).",
      "Handle the sample tube carefully to avoid breaking the glass ends.",
      "Calibrate the instrument regularly using a quartz control plate."
