  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the controlled addition of liquid reagents into a reaction mixture using a dropping funnel.",
    "scope": "Applicable to synthetic activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Inspect the dropping funnel for any cracks or chips and ensure the stopcock is clean.",
      "Apply a small amount of grease to the stopcock if it is made of ground glass.",
      "Close the stopcock and mount the funnel onto the reaction flask using a ground-glass joint.",
      "Secure the funnel with a clamp to a laboratory stand.",
      "Pour the liquid reagent carefully into the funnel using a small glass funnel.",
      "Place a stopper on the top of the dropping funnel (ensure it is a pressure-equalizing type if the system is closed).",
      "Adjust the stopcock to achieve the desired drop rate into the reaction mixture.",
      "Monitor the addition process and the reaction temperature throughout.",
      "Once the addition is complete, close the stopcock and remove the funnel.",
      "Clean the funnel thoroughly with appropriate solvents immediately after use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the dropping funnel is properly vented to prevent pressure buildup.",
      "Do not fill the funnel to more than 80% of its capacity.",
      "Check that the stopcock is not leaking before adding hazardous reagents.",
      "Handle the funnel carefully as it is fragile and can easily tip over if not clamped properly.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE including safety glasses and gloves."
