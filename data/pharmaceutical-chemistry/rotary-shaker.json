    "purpose": "To provide gentle to vigorous mixing of samples in a rotational motion.",
    "scope": "Applicable to extractions and microbial cultures in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Secure the samples in the clamps or racks on the rotating platform.",
      "Balance the load evenly across the platform.",
      "Set the rotation speed and duration on the control panel.",
      "Switch ON the shaker and monitor the initial motion.",
      "Adjust the speed if the mixing is too gentle or causing splashes.",
      "Turn OFF the power and wait for the platform to stop before unloading.",
      "Clean the platform of any chemical residue."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overload the shaker beyond its weight specifications.",
      "Ensure all containers are tightly capped to prevent leakage.",
      "Check for loose clamps periodically during the run.",
      "Avoid high-speed operation for top-heavy containers.",
      "Keep the motor area free from dust and debris."
