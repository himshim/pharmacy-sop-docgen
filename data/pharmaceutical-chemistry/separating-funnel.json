    "purpose": "To separate two immiscible liquid phases during liquid-liquid extraction.",
    "scope": "Applicable to extraction and purification in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check the stopcock for leaks and ensure it is properly greased or fitted with a PTFE plug.",
      "Pour the liquid mixture into the funnel using a glass funnel.",
      "Insert the stopper and shake the funnel gently, venting frequently by opening the stopcock.",
      "Place the funnel in a ring stand and allow the layers to separate clearly.",
      "Remove the stopper to prevent a vacuum from forming during drainage.",
      "Open the stopcock and slowly drain the lower layer into a beaker.",
      "Close the stopcock just as the interface reaches the opening.",
      "Pour the upper layer out through the top of the funnel to avoid contamination.",
      "Clean the funnel thoroughly with appropriate solvents after use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always vent the funnel away from yourself and others to release pressure.",
      "Ensure the stopper is held securely with a finger during shaking.",
      "Do not fill the funnel more than 3/4 full.",
      "Handle the funnel with care as the neck and stem are easily broken.",
      "Dispose of unwanted layers in the correct chemical waste container."
