    "purpose": "To separate a volatile liquid from non-volatile impurities or other liquids with significant boiling point differences.",
    "scope": "Applicable to solvent purification in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Assemble the distillation flask, distillation head, condenser, and receiver.",
      "Secure all joints and ensure the thermometer bulb is correctly positioned.",
      "Connect the cooling water to the condenser (inlet at the bottom).",
      "Add the sample and boiling chips to the distillation flask.",
      "Turn ON the heating mantle and slowly increase the temperature.",
      "Collect the distillate in the receiver at the constant boiling point.",
      "Stop heating before the flask becomes completely dry.",
      "Allow the unit to cool before dismantling and cleaning."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the system is vented to the atmosphere; never heat a closed system.",
      "Monitor the thermometer closely to identify the pure fraction.",
      "Check for leaks in the joints where vapors might escape.",
      "Handle hot glassware with heat-resistant gloves.",
      "Discard the initial distillate (forerun) if it contains impurities."
