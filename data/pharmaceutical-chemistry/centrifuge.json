    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the separation of components based on density using a laboratory centrifuge.",
    "scope": "Applicable to separation activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the centrifuge is placed on a stable, level surface.",
      "Open the centrifuge lid and inspect the rotor and buckets for cleanliness.",
      "Fill the centrifuge tubes with equal volumes of the sample solution.",
      "Place the tubes in opposite buckets to ensure a balanced load.",
      "If using an odd number of samples, use a balance tube filled with water of equal weight.",
      "Close the lid securely and ensure the interlock is engaged.",
      "Set the required speed (RPM or RCF) and time on the control panel.",
      "Start the centrifuge and wait for it to reach the set speed.",
      "Monitor for any unusual noise or vibration; stop immediately if detected.",
      "Wait for the rotor to come to a complete stop before opening the lid.",
      "Carefully remove the tubes and proceed with the separation of the supernatant.",
      "Clean any spills inside the centrifuge immediately and document the run."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never operate the centrifuge with an unbalanced load.",
      "Do not attempt to open the lid or touch the rotor while it is spinning.",
      "Ensure the tubes are compatible with the rotor speed and chemicals used.",
      "Regularly inspect the rotor and buckets for signs of fatigue or corrosion.",
      "Use appropriate biohazard or chemical safety protocols when handling hazardous samples."
