  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for vacuum filtration using a Buchner funnel assembly.",
    "scope": "Applicable to filtration activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Assemble the Buchner funnel onto the vacuum flask using a rubber adapter/gasket.",
      "Connect the side arm of the vacuum flask to a vacuum pump using thick-walled tubing.",
      "Place a filter paper of correct size in the funnel so it lies flat and covers all holes.",
      "Moisten the filter paper with a small amount of the solvent being used.",
      "Turn ON the vacuum pump and check for a proper seal between the funnel and flask.",
      "Pour the slurry or solution to be filtered slowly into the center of the funnel.",
      "Allow the liquid to be pulled through the filter into the flask.",
      "Rinse the solids in the funnel with a small amount of cold solvent if required.",
      "Once the filtration is complete, disconnect the vacuum hose before turning off the pump.",
      "Carefully remove the funnel and collect the filtered solid (cake) from the filter paper.",
      "Discard the filtrate or transfer it to another container as per requirements.",
      "Clean the funnel and flask thoroughly with appropriate solvents."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the vacuum flask is made of thick-walled glass to withstand pressure.",
      "Do not use filter paper that is larger than the funnel diameter.",
      "Ensure the vacuum is released before shutting off the pump to prevent back-flow.",
      "Inspect the glassware for cracks or chips before applying vacuum.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE including safety goggles and lab coat."
