  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for removing stubborn residues from intricate glassware using ultrasonic technology.",
    "scope": "Applicable to glassware maintenance in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fill the cleaner with water and add a mild laboratory detergent.",
      "Load the glassware into the rack ensuring they do not clink together.",
      "Submerge the rack into the ultrasonic bath.",
      "Set the timer (typically 10-20 minutes) and start the operation.",
      "Observe for cavitation bubbles effectively removing residues from hard-to-reach areas.",
      "Once finished, rinse the glassware thoroughly with deionized water.",
      "Empty and clean the bath at the end of each day.",
      "Dry the cleaner basin with a lint-free cloth."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not use highly acidic or alkaline solutions that could damage the basin.",
      "Ensure volumetric glassware is not subjected to high heat in the bath.",
      "Check for cracks in glassware before ultrasonication to prevent breakage.",
      "Do not leave the unit running unattended for extended periods.",
      "Wear gloves when handling detergents and rinsed glassware."
