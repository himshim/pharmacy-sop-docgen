  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To separate a mixture of miscible liquids with close boiling points using a fractionating column.",
    "scope": "Applicable to purification processes in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Assemble the distillation flask, fractionating column, and condenser.",
      "Ensure all joints are secured with clips and lightly greased.",
      "Fill the flask with the mixture (max 2/3 full) and add boiling chips.",
      "Start the cooling water flow through the condenser jacket.",
      "Gradually increase the heat to maintain a steady reflux in the column.",
      "Monitor the thermometer at the top of the column for constant temperature plateaus.",
      "Collect the different fractions in separate receiving flasks.",
      "Stop heating when the desired fractions have been collected.",
      "Allow the unit to cool to room temperature before dismantling."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure the fractionating column is insulated to maintain the temperature gradient.",
      "Never heat a completely closed system; ensure a vent is present.",
      "Monitor the heating rate to avoid flooding the column.",
      "Handle hot glassware with appropriate protective equipment.",
      "Discard the forerun and residue as per chemical waste SOPs."
