  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for providing reduced pressure for laboratory applications.",
    "scope": "Applicable to all vacuum-dependent activities in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check the oil level in the sight glass (for oil-sealed pumps).",
      "Ensure the exhaust is vented to a fume hood or has a proper filter.",
      "Connect the pump to the application using reinforced vacuum tubing.",
      "Switch ON the pump and allow it to reach its operating vacuum level.",
      "When finished, isolate the pump from the system using a valve.",
      "Bleed air into the pump intake before switching it OFF.",
      "Record the usage hours in the equipment logbook.",
      "Change the pump oil at regular intervals as per the maintenance schedule."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never run the pump with the intake open to the atmosphere for long periods.",
      "Use a cold trap to prevent solvent vapors from entering the pump and degrading the oil.",
      "Do not touch the pump housing during operation as it may become hot.",
      "Inspect tubing for kinks, cracks, or collapses regularly.",
      "Follow lockout/tagout procedures during oil changes or maintenance."
