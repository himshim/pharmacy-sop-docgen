    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for simple distillation to purify solvents or separate components.",
    "scope": "Applicable to synthesis and purification activities in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Assemble the distillation flask, distillation head, condenser, and receiving flask.",
      "Secure all joints with Keck clips and apply a light coating of vacuum grease to ground-glass joints.",
      "Connect the water inlet and outlet to the condenser and check for proper flow.",
      "Place the liquid to be distilled into the flask, adding 2-3 boiling chips/stones.",
      "Ensure the thermometer is positioned correctly with the bulb at the level of the side arm.",
      "Place the distillation flask in a heating mantle or oil bath.",
      "Slowly turn ON the heat and monitor the temperature rise.",
      "Collect the distillate in the receiving flask once the desired temperature is reached.",
      "Discard the initial fraction (forerun) if required by the protocol.",
      "Stop heating before the distillation flask becomes completely dry.",
      "Allow the assembly to cool down before dismantling and cleaning."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Never heat a closed system; ensure the assembly is vented to the atmosphere.",
      "Check for leaks in the assembly before starting the heat.",
      "Ensure the cooling water is flowing steadily through the condenser.",
      "Handle hot glassware with heat-resistant gloves.",
      "Dispose of the residue in the distillation flask according to chemical waste SOPs."
