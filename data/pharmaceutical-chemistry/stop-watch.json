    "purpose": "To measure elapsed time for laboratory experiments and reaction monitoring.",
    "scope": "Applicable to procedural timing in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Clear the display by pressing the 'RESET' button.",
      "Press 'START' at the beginning of the timed event.",
      "Press 'STOP' at the conclusion of the event.",
      "Record the elapsed time in seconds or minutes in the logbook.",
      "Use the 'LAP' function if multiple sequential events need to be timed.",
      "Reset the watch after the final reading is recorded.",
      "Store the stop watch in a dry place to prevent moisture damage."

    "precautions": [
      "Check the battery status regularly to ensure it doesn't fail during an experiment.",
      "Do not handle the stop watch with wet or chemical-stained hands.",
      "Avoid exposing the device to extreme heat or magnetic fields.",
      "Verify the timing accuracy against a standardized clock annually.",
      "Keep the stop watch clean and free from dust."
