    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the refrigerator is set to a temperature between 2°C and 8°C.",
      "Store chemicals in clearly labeled, tightly sealed containers.",
      "Organize items such that older reagents are used first (FIFO).",
      "Avoid blocking the internal air vents with boxes or bottles.",
      "Monitor and record the temperature on a daily log sheet.",
      "Clean the interior surfaces monthly with a mild disinfectant.",

    "precautions": [
      "Never store food or beverages in a laboratory refrigerator.",
      "Do not store flammables in a standard household-style refrigerator.",
      "Minimize the duration the door is kept open to maintain stability.",
      "Ensure there is a secondary containment for hazardous liquid chemicals.",
      "Report any temperature excursions immediately for risk assessment."
