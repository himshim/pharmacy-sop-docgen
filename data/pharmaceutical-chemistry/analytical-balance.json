    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the accurate weighing of pharmaceutical ingredients using an analytical balance.",
    "scope": "Applicable to weighing activities carried out in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the balance is placed on a stable, vibration-free weighing table.",
      "Check the spirit level and adjust the leveling feet until the bubble is centered.",
      "Verify that the balance is clean and the weighing pan is free from debris.",
      "Power ON the balance and allow it to stabilize for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Perform internal or external calibration as per the frequency specified in the calibration SOP.",
      "Open the draft shield and place the weighing boat or paper on the pan.",
      "Close the draft shield and press the 'TARE' or 'ZERO' button.",
      "Add the substance to be weighed carefully into the weighing boat.",
      "Close the draft shield and wait for the stability indicator to appear.",
      "Record the final weight reading in the logbook or batch record.",
      "Remove the weighing boat and clean any spilled material from the balance chamber immediately.",
      "Switch OFF the balance (or put in standby) and close the draft shield after use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not weigh hot or cold objects; allow them to reach room temperature first.",
      "Handle the draft shield gently to avoid disturbing the balance sensors.",
      "Avoid touching the weighing pan or boat with bare hands (use forceps/gloves).",
      "Do not exceed the maximum capacity of the balance.",
      "Maintain a clean environment around the balance to prevent interference."
