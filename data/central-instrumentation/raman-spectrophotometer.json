    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Raman Spectrophotometer for molecular fingerprinting, structural characterization, and identification of pharmaceutical materials using Raman spectroscopy.",
    "scope": "Applicable to Raman spectroscopy activities carried out in the Central Instrumentation.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the instrument is placed in a vibration-free, temperature-controlled environment.",
      "Power ON the Raman spectrometer and allow the laser and detector to stabilize.",
      "Initialize the control software and verify system status indicators.",
      "Perform wavelength calibration using standard reference materials (e.g., silicon, naphthalene).",
      "Verify that calibration results meet acceptable criteria for accuracy.",
      "Select appropriate laser wavelength and power based on sample characteristics.",
      "Choose the objective lens appropriate for the sample type and required spot size.",
      "Prepare the sample ensuring it is clean and properly positioned on the stage.",
      "For solid samples, place directly on the stage or in appropriate sample holder.",
      "For liquid samples, use cuvettes or sealed vials appropriate for Raman analysis.",
      "Focus the laser on the sample surface using the microscope viewing system.",
      "Adjust laser power to avoid sample heating or degradation (start with low power).",
      "Set acquisition parameters including integration time, number of accumulations, and spectral range.",
      "Acquire a test spectrum and check for adequate signal-to-noise ratio.",
      "Optimize parameters if necessary to improve spectral quality.",
      "Acquire final spectrum with optimized parameters.",
      "Save the spectrum with proper identification including sample name and acquisition parameters.",
      "Perform spectral analysis including peak identification and library matching if needed.",
      "Clean the sample stage and objective lens carefully after measurements.",
      "Document all spectral data, laser settings, and observations in the analytical record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid looking directly at the laser beam as it can cause eye damage.",
      "Use appropriate laser safety measures including interlocks and warning signs.",
      "Start with low laser power to prevent sample burning or fluorescence.",
      "Be aware of fluorescence interference which can obscure Raman signals.",
      "Use appropriate sample holders to avoid background interference.",
      "Handle the objective lens with care and clean only with lens tissue.",
      "Ensure samples are dry if moisture is incompatible with the measurement.",
      "Avoid highly absorbing or photosensitive samples at high laser power.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE and follow laser safety protocols."
