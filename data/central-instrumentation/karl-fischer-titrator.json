    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Karl Fischer Titrator for accurate determination of water content in pharmaceutical samples using coulometric or volumetric methods.",
    "scope": "Applicable to moisture determination activities carried out in the Central Instrumentation.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the instrument is placed in a dry environment away from moisture sources.",
      "Check that all reagent bottles contain sufficient Karl Fischer reagent and are properly sealed.",
      "Verify that the titration cell and electrodes are clean and in good condition.",
      "Power ON the Karl Fischer titrator and initialize the control software.",
      "Fill the titration vessel with appropriate solvent (methanol or Karl Fischer solvent).",
      "Perform conditioning of the cell by running blank titrations until drift is stable.",
      "Verify that the drift rate is within acceptable limits before sample analysis.",
      "Accurately weigh the sample using an analytical balance and record the weight.",
      "Quickly transfer the sample into the titration vessel to minimize atmospheric moisture exposure.",
      "Start the titration and allow the instrument to detect the endpoint automatically.",
      "Record the water content result displayed by the instrument in mg or percentage.",
      "Perform duplicate or triplicate determinations to ensure precision.",
      "Calculate the average water content and check if results are within specifications.",
      "After analysis, dispose of the titration solution as per chemical waste guidelines.",
      "Clean the titration cell and electrodes if necessary for the next analysis.",
      "Store Karl Fischer reagents in tightly sealed bottles to prevent moisture absorption.",
      "Document all weighings, titration results, and calculations in the analytical record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Handle Karl Fischer reagents with care as they are corrosive and toxic.",
      "Always work in a well-ventilated area or fume hood when handling reagents.",
      "Minimize sample exposure to atmospheric moisture during weighing and transfer.",
      "Use dry glassware and syringes to prevent contamination.",
      "Keep reagent bottles tightly sealed when not in use.",
      "Regularly check electrode condition and replace if response is poor.",
      "Avoid introducing samples containing substances that interfere with Karl Fischer reaction.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE including lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles.",
      "Dispose of waste reagents as per hazardous chemical waste disposal protocols."
