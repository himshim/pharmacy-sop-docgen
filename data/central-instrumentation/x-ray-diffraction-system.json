    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) System for characterization of crystalline pharmaceutical materials, polymorphism studies, and phase identification.",
    "scope": "Applicable to X-ray diffraction analysis activities carried out in the Central Instrumentation.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the XRD system is installed in a temperature-controlled, low-humidity environment.",
      "Verify that the cooling water supply for the X-ray tube is functioning properly.",
      "Check that all safety interlocks and radiation shielding are in place.",
      "Power ON the X-ray diffraction system and initialize the control software.",
      "Allow the X-ray tube to warm up gradually following manufacturer protocol.",
      "Set the X-ray tube voltage and current to the desired operating conditions.",
      "Verify that the goniometer is properly aligned and the detector is functional.",
      "Prepare the sample by grinding to fine powder if necessary for powder XRD.",
      "Load the sample into the sample holder ensuring uniform packing and flat surface.",
      "Use back-loading or side-loading technique to minimize preferred orientation effects.",
      "Mount the sample holder on the goniometer stage securely.",
      "Align the sample surface with the goniometer reference height using Z-adjustment.",
      "Set scan parameters including start angle, end angle, step size, and scan speed.",
      "Close the safety door and ensure all radiation safety interlocks are engaged.",
      "Start the XRD scan and monitor the initial data acquisition.",
      "Allow the scan to complete, which may take from 30 minutes to several hours.",
      "After completion, the system will return to the start position automatically.",
      "Open the safety door and carefully remove the sample holder.",
      "Save the diffraction pattern data with proper identification.",
      "Perform phase identification using database matching or Rietveld refinement.",
      "Clean the sample holder and prepare for next analysis.",
      "Power OFF the X-ray tube following proper shutdown sequence.",
      "Document all acquisition parameters, sample details, and results in the analytical record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "X-ray radiation is hazardous - never bypass safety interlocks or open the chamber during operation.",
      "Ensure all personnel are trained in radiation safety and wear dosimetry badges.",
      "Verify cooling water flow before operating the X-ray tube.",
      "Never increase voltage or current too rapidly to prevent tube damage.",
      "Ensure samples are dry and free from volatile components.",
      "Avoid preferred orientation by proper sample preparation techniques.",
      "Use appropriate sample holders compatible with the measurement geometry.",
      "Keep the instrument area clean and free from dust.",
      "Perform regular maintenance of the X-ray tube and detector.",
      "Follow institutional radiation safety protocols strictly."
