    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of UV Fluorescence Spectrophotometer for qualitative and quantitative analysis of fluorescent pharmaceutical compounds by measuring emission spectra after UV excitation.",
    "scope": "Applicable to fluorescence spectroscopy activities carried out in the Central Instrumentation.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the instrument is placed in a dark or low-light environment to minimize interference.",
      "Power ON the spectrofluorometer and allow the lamp to warm up for at least 15-30 minutes.",
      "Initialize the control software and verify system status.",
      "Perform wavelength calibration using standard reference materials (e.g., Raman peak of water).",
      "Set the excitation wavelength based on the absorption maximum of the sample.",
      "Set the emission wavelength range to capture the fluorescence spectrum.",
      "Adjust slit widths for both excitation and emission monochromators for desired resolution.",
      "Set the PMT voltage or gain to appropriate level for expected fluorescence intensity.",
      "Prepare blank solution using the same solvent as samples.",
      "Use quartz cuvettes as they have minimal fluorescence and UV transparency.",
      "Fill the cuvette with blank solution ensuring no air bubbles are present.",
      "Place the cuvette in the sample holder with proper orientation.",
      "Acquire blank spectrum and save for background correction.",
      "Prepare sample and standard solutions in appropriate concentrations.",
      "Rinse the cuvette with sample solution before filling.",
      "Fill the cuvette with sample solution and place in the holder.",
      "Acquire the fluorescence spectrum and monitor signal intensity.",
      "If signal is too weak or saturated, adjust PMT voltage or sample concentration.",
      "Perform replicate measurements to ensure reproducibility.",
      "Save all spectra with proper identification and perform background correction if needed.",
      "Clean cuvettes thoroughly with appropriate solvents after use.",
      "Document all parameters including excitation/emission wavelengths, slit widths, and concentrations."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Always use quartz cuvettes for UV-fluorescence measurements.",
      "Ensure samples are free from particulates that can scatter light.",
      "Avoid photobleaching by minimizing exposure time to excitation light.",
      "Use appropriate sample concentration to avoid inner filter effects and self-quenching.",
      "Handle cuvettes by frosted sides only to avoid fingerprints on optical surfaces.",
      "Ensure solvents used are non-fluorescent or have minimal fluorescence.",
      "Protect samples from ambient light if they are photosensitive.",
      "Avoid oxygen quenching by degassing samples if necessary.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE when handling samples and solvents.",
      "Perform regular lamp checks and replace when intensity decreases significantly."
