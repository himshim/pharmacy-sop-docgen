    "purpose": "To describe the standard operating procedure for the operation of Zeta Potential Analyzer for measurement of zeta potential and electrophoretic mobility of pharmaceutical suspensions, emulsions, and nanoparticles to assess colloidal stability.",
    "scope": "Applicable to zeta potential measurement activities carried out in the Central Instrumentation.",
    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the instrument is placed on a stable surface in a temperature-controlled environment.",
      "Power ON the zeta potential analyzer and initialize the control software.",
      "Allow the laser and electronics to warm up and stabilize for at least 15 minutes.",
      "Select the appropriate measurement cell (disposable or reusable) based on sample type.",
      "If using reusable cells, clean the electrodes thoroughly and verify they are not corroded.",
      "Prepare the sample dispersion ensuring appropriate particle concentration.",
      "Adjust the pH or add electrolyte if required for the study.",
      "For best results, use dilute samples with low ionic strength unless studying specific conditions.",
      "Fill the measurement cell with sample ensuring no air bubbles are trapped.",
      "Insert the cell into the measurement chamber with proper orientation.",
      "Allow the sample to equilibrate thermally for a few minutes.",
      "Set measurement parameters including number of runs, voltage, and delay time.",
      "Start the measurement and allow the instrument to apply electric field across the electrodes.",
      "Monitor the electrophoretic mobility measurement in real-time.",
      "The instrument will automatically calculate zeta potential from mobility data.",
      "Record the zeta potential value along with distribution and quality indicators.",
      "Perform replicate measurements (typically 3-5) to ensure reproducibility.",
      "Review the quality parameters to ensure data validity.",
      "After measurements, clean the cell thoroughly with distilled water.",
      "For reusable cells, clean electrodes with appropriate cleaning solution and dry.",
      "Save all data files with proper identification and document sample preparation details.",
      "Generate reports including zeta potential distribution plots and statistical parameters."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use appropriate sample concentration to avoid multiple scattering effects.",
      "Ensure samples are free from large particles or aggregates that can settle.",
      "Use filtered or degassed water for sample preparation.",
      "Avoid air bubbles in the measurement cell as they interfere with measurements.",
      "Clean electrodes thoroughly between samples to prevent contamination.",
      "Check electrode condition regularly and replace if corroded or damaged.",
      "Use appropriate ionic strength for accurate zeta potential determination.",
      "Maintain constant temperature during measurements as zeta potential is temperature-dependent.",
      "Wear appropriate PPE when handling samples and cleaning solutions.",
      "Perform regular calibration using zeta potential standards."
