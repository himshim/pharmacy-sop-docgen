    "purpose": "To measure and record systemic arterial blood pressure in experimental animals.",
    "scope": "Applicable to cardiovascular pharmacology studies.",
    "procedure": [
      "Calibrate the pressure transducer and chart recorder.",
      "Anesthetize the animal and cannulate the carotid or femoral artery.",
      "Connect the cannula to saline-filled tubing and the pressure transducer.",
      "Zero the transducer at arterial level.",
      "Record baseline blood pressure waveform.",
      "Administer test compound and record changes.",
      "Euthanize the animal humanely at the end of the experiment.",
      "Clean and sterilize all reusable components."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use aseptic technique for cannulation.",
      "Monitor animal vital signs continuously.",
      "Flush lines regularly to prevent clotting.",
      "Handle glass components carefully.",
      "Dispose of biological waste appropriately."
