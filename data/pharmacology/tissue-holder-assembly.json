    "purpose": "To securely hold isolated tissues or organs in position within an organ bath or recording setup.",
    "scope": "Applicable to isolated tissue experiments in Pharmacology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Select appropriate hooks, clips, or frames according to tissue type.",
      "Attach one end of the tissue to the fixed hook and the other to the transducer or lever.",
      "Adjust the position to ensure the tissue is submerged without stretching beyond physiological limits.",
      "Tighten screws or clamps gently to secure the assembly.",
      "Inspect alignment periodically during the experiment and adjust if necessary."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid crushing or tearing tissue during mounting.",
      "Use corrosion-resistant materials compatible with solutions.",
      "Handle sharp hooks and needles carefully.",
      "Clean and disinfect components between experiments.",
      "Store small parts in labeled containers to prevent loss."
