    "purpose": "To study active and passive avoidance behavior in animals.",
    "scope": "Applicable to learning, memory, and psychopharmacology experiments.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the animal in one compartment of the shuttle box.",
      "Present the conditioned stimulus followed by an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., mild shock).",
      "Allow the animal to cross to the opposite compartment to avoid or escape the shock.",
      "Record latency to cross and number of avoidance and escape responses.",
      "Repeat trials according to the experimental schedule.",
      "Clean the compartments after each animal."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use humane shock intensities and durations.",
      "Standardize trial timing and inter-trial intervals.",
      "Monitor animals for signs of distress.",
      "Ensure doors and sensors function reliably.",
      "Follow ethical guidelines for behavioral conditioning."
