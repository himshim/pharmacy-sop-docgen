  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To measure changes in paw or limb volume for evaluation of edema and anti-inflammatory activity.",
    "scope": "Applicable to acute and chronic inflammation models in Pharmacology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fill the measuring chamber with the designated fluid (e.g., mercury or saline) to the mark.",
      "Zero the reading on the plethysmometer scale or digital display.",
      "Gently immerse the animal paw up to the anatomical landmark without excessive pressure.",
      "Record baseline paw volume and subsequent readings after inducing edema and treatment.",
      "Clean and disinfect the measuring chamber after each animal."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid trapping air bubbles in the measuring fluid.",
      "Ensure consistent depth of paw immersion across measurements.",
      "Handle mercury with appropriate hazardous material precautions if used.",
      "Do not restrain the animal excessively to avoid stress.",
      "Calibrate the instrument regularly for accuracy."
