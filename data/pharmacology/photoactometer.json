    "purpose": "To assess locomotor activity of animals using photoelectric beam interruptions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to CNS stimulant and depressant screening in Pharmacology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the photoactometer and allow a brief warm-up period.",
      "Check that all photoelectric cells and indicators are functioning.",
      "Place the test animal in the observation arena and close the lid.",
      "Set the observation period using an external or built-in timer.",
      "Start the test and record the activity counts at the end of the session.",
      "Remove the animal and clean the arena with disinfectant between tests."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Maintain uniform lighting conditions around the apparatus.",
      "Avoid placing reflective objects near the sensors.",
      "Ensure the arena floor is non-slippery.",
      "Handle animals gently to avoid stress-induced variability.",
      "Calibrate sensor sensitivity periodically."
