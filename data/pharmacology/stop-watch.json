    "purpose": "To manually record time intervals in behavioral and physiological experiments.",
    "scope": "Applicable to general timing needs in Pharmacology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Check that the stop watch is reset to zero.",
      "Start timing at the defined event (e.g., stimulus onset or animal placement).",
      "Stop timing at the response event (e.g., withdrawal, crossing, fall).",
      "Record the measured time immediately in the data sheet.",
      "Reset the stop watch before the next trial."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use a functioning, calibrated device to avoid drift.",
      "Minimize reaction-time bias by training observers.",
      "For very short latencies, consider automated timing systems.",
      "Protect the device from moisture and mechanical shock.",
      "Replace batteries as needed."
