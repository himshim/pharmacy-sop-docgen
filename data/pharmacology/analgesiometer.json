    "purpose": "To measure pain threshold and analgesic effects using thermal stimulus.",
    "scope": "Applicable to analgesic drug screening.",
    "procedure": [
      "Set the hot plate temperature to 55°C ± 1°C.",
      "Place the animal on the heated plate and start the timer.",
      "Observe and record the reaction time (paw lick, jump, or vocalization).",
      "Remove the animal immediately after response.",
      "Calculate the mean reaction time for control and treated groups.",
      "Clean the plate surface between animals."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not exceed safe exposure times to prevent tissue damage.",
      "Use a cutoff time (e.g., 10 seconds) to avoid burns.",
      "Handle animals humanely and minimize stress.",
      "Test only trained observers for consistency.",
      "Calibrate temperature daily."
