  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To provide mechanical recording of tissue or muscle contractions for teaching demonstrations.",
    "scope": "Applicable to undergraduate Pharmacology practicals.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fix a kymograph drum with smoked or paper-coated surface.",
      "Attach the writing lever from the tissue to the drum.",
      "Set the drum speed according to the experiment.",
      "Start the drum rotation and apply stimuli or drugs to the tissue.",
      "Allow the lever to inscribe contractions on the drum surface.",
      "At the end, stop the drum and remove the recording for evaluation."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure proper lubrication of mechanical parts.",
      "Avoid excessive loading on the writing lever.",
      "Use care when handling smoked paper and fixatives.",
      "Keep electrical components away from water.",
      "Supervise students during setup and operation."
