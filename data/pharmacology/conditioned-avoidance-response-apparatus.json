    "purpose": "To assess learning and memory using conditioned avoidance paradigm.",
    "scope": "Applicable to psychopharmacology and nootropic drug screening.",
    "procedure": [
      "Acclimatize the animal to the shuttle box for 5 minutes.",
      "Condition the animal with 50 trials (conditioned stimulus followed by unconditioned stimulus).",
      "Test avoidance learning the next day with 20–30 trials.",
      "Record avoidance latency and response accuracy.",
      "Calculate percent avoidance and trials to criterion.",
      "Clean the apparatus thoroughly between animals."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use consistent stimulus intensities and timing.",
      "Minimize handling stress between sessions.",
      "Ensure electric shock is humane (max 0.5 mA).",
      "Monitor for signs of excessive fear or aggression.",
      "Verify all sensors and shock delivery systems function properly."
