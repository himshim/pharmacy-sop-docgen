  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To assess neuromuscular function by measuring forelimb or hindlimb grip strength in rodents.",
    "scope": "Applicable to neuropharmacology and toxicity studies.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the animal so that it grasps the grid or bar with its paws.",
      "Gently pull the animal backward by the tail until it releases its grip.",
      "Record the peak force displayed.",
      "Repeat for a set number of trials and calculate mean grip strength.",
      "Clean the grip surface between animals."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not jerk the animal; apply smooth, consistent force.",
      "Avoid testing if the animal shows limb injuries.",
      "Ensure the device is properly calibrated.",
      "Use the same operator to reduce variability.",
      "Handle animals gently to reduce stress."
