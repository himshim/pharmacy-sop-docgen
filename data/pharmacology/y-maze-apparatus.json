    "purpose": "To assess spatial working memory and exploratory behavior using spontaneous alternation in a Y-shaped maze.",
    "scope": "Applicable to nootropic and CNS drug evaluation.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the animal at the end of one arm and allow free exploration of all three arms for a fixed period (e.g., 5–8 minutes).",
      "Record the sequence and number of arm entries.",
      "Calculate percentage alternation as an index of working memory.",
      "Remove the animal and return it to its home cage.",
      "Clean the maze with 70% alcohol between animals."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Maintain consistent lighting and noise conditions.",
      "Do not reuse animals without appropriate washout if drug effects are long-lasting.",
      "Avoid strong odor cues that may bias arm choice.",
      "Ensure non-slippery flooring.",
      "Handle animals gently before and after testing."
