    "purpose": "To assess motor coordination and balance in rodents using a rotating rod.",
    "scope": "Applicable to neuropharmacology and toxicity studies.",
    "procedure": [
      "Set the rotation speed and acceleration mode as per protocol.",
      "Place the animal on the rod facing opposite to the direction of rotation.",
      "Start the rotation and timer simultaneously.",
      "Record the time until the animal falls from the rod.",
      "Repeat for the required number of trials and calculate the mean fall latency.",
      "Clean the rod surface between animals."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Train animals prior to baseline measurements if required.",
      "Prevent injury by providing a cushioned landing surface.",
      "Use consistent rod diameter and texture across experiments.",
      "Do not exceed speeds that cause immediate falls in all animals.",
      "Monitor animals for signs of fatigue or distress."
