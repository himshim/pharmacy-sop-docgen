  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To convert mechanical force (e.g., tissue contraction) into an electrical signal for recording.",
    "scope": "Applicable to isolated organ and muscle studies.",
    "procedure": [
      "Connect the force transducer to the recording system input.",
      "Securely attach the tissue or preparation to the transducer hook.",
      "Zero the transducer output with no load applied.",
      "Apply a defined resting tension to the tissue.",
      "Start recording and observe force changes during drug application.",
      "At the end, release tension and verify transducer returns to baseline.",
      "Rinse and dry the transducer hook and surrounding area."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not exceed the rated force capacity.",
      "Avoid mechanical shocks or bending of the transducer arm.",
      "Prevent liquid spills from entering the housing.",
      "Calibrate periodically using known weights.",
      "Store the transducer in a protective case when not in use."
