  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To study drug effects on isolated tissues in vitro.",
    "scope": "Applicable to smooth muscle and tissue pharmacology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fill the organ bath with appropriate physiological solution and maintain at 37°C.",
      "Bubble the solution with a gas mixture (e.g., carbogen).",
      "Mount the isolated tissue between the hook and force transducer.",
      "Apply initial resting tension and allow equilibration with regular washing.",
      "Administer drugs in cumulative or non-cumulative manner as per protocol.",
      "Record tissue responses and wash between doses.",
      "At the end, discard tissue and clean the bath thoroughly."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid tissue damage during mounting.",
      "Maintain constant temperature and pH of the bath.",
      "Use fresh physiological solution.",
      "Prevent air bubbles from contacting the tissue.",
      "Handle sharps and biological waste as per SOP."
