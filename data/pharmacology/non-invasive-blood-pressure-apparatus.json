    "purpose": "To measure arterial blood pressure in conscious animals using tail-cuff or similar methods.",
    "scope": "Applicable to chronic cardiovascular studies.",
    "procedure": [
      "Acclimatize animals to the restrainer and warm environment.",
      "Place the cuff around the tail or limb as per device design.",
      "Start the measurement cycle and allow automatic inflation/deflation.",
      "Record systolic (and diastolic/mean if available) pressures.",
      "Repeat measurements and calculate average values.",
      "Clean cuffs and restrainers after use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Do not overtighten the cuff.",
      "Avoid using in very stressed or cold animals (affects tail blood flow).",
      "Check device calibration regularly.",
      "Monitor animals to prevent escape or injury.",
      "Use appropriate restrainers suited to species and size."
