    "purpose": "To measure arterial blood pressure directly via vascular cannulation.",
    "scope": "Applicable to detailed cardiovascular pharmacology experiments.",
    "procedure": [
      "Cannulate the selected artery under anesthesia.",
      "Connect the cannula to a fluid-filled pressure line and transducer.",
      "Zero the transducer at heart level.",
      "Start recording baseline blood pressure.",
      "Administer test drugs and record changes in systolic, diastolic, and mean pressure.",
      "Flush the line periodically to prevent clot formation.",
      "Euthanize the animal humanely and clean equipment."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Maintain strict aseptic technique.",
      "Avoid introduction of air bubbles into the arterial line.",
      "Monitor anesthesia depth continuously.",
      "Use anticoagulant in flush solution if required.",
      "Dispose of sharps and biological waste safely."
