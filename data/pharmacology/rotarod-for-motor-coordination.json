  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To evaluate drug-induced changes in motor coordination and muscle relaxation.",
    "scope": "Applicable to screening of sedative, myorelaxant, and neuroactive drugs.",
    "procedure": [
      "Adjust the rotarod speed or acceleration profile according to the study design.",
      "Place multiple animals on separate lanes of the rotating rod if available.",
      "Start rotation and measure retention time until each animal falls.",
      "Record individual fall times and calculate group means.",
      "Perform baseline and post-treatment assessments at defined time points."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure lane dividers are intact to prevent animals from clustering.",
      "Clean fecal or urine contamination promptly to maintain grip.",
      "Avoid repeated testing causing exhaustion.",
      "Use the same operator when possible to reduce variability.",
      "Check mechanical parts regularly for smooth operation."
