    "purpose": "To measure spinal reflex latency to a thermal stimulus applied to the tail.",
    "scope": "Applicable to evaluation of analgesic drugs acting at spinal level.",
    "procedure": [
      "Switch ON the instrument and set the intensity of the heat source.",
      "Place the animal so that the distal part of the tail is positioned over the heat source.",
      "Start the timer simultaneously with heat application.",
      "Stop the timer when the animal flicks its tail and record the latency.",
      "Apply a cutoff time to prevent tissue injury.",
      "Allow adequate recovery time between repeated measurements."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use the lowest effective heat intensity.",
      "Do not exceed predetermined cutoff times.",
      "Do not test animals with tail injuries or skin lesions.",
      "Calibrate the heat source output regularly.",
      "Follow ethical guidelines for pain studies."
