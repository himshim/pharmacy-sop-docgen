  },
  "sections": {
    "purpose": "To measure pain response latency using a heated surface.",
    "scope": "Applicable to central analgesic drug evaluation.",
    "procedure": [
      "Set the hot plate temperature to the specified value (usually 55°C).",
      "Allow the plate to reach and stabilize at the set temperature.",
      "Place the animal on the hot plate and start the timer.",
      "Observe for pain responses such as paw licking or jumping.",
      "Stop the timer at the first response and immediately remove the animal.",
      "Record reaction time and apply cutoff time to prevent injury.",
      "Clean the plate surface after each test."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use strict cutoff times to avoid burns.",
      "Do not test animals with existing paw injuries.",
      "Calibrate temperature regularly.",
      "Do not leave animals unattended on the plate.",
      "Follow ethical guidelines for pain studies."
