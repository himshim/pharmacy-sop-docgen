    "purpose": "To demonstrate basic principles of drug action on isolated tissues for teaching purposes.",
    "scope": "Applicable to undergraduate experimental Pharmacology exercises.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fill the student organ bath with physiological solution and maintain at appropriate temperature.",
      "Mount the selected tissue preparation using hooks and levers.",
      "Apply initial tension and allow tissue to equilibrate with periodic washing.",
      "Add drugs in graded concentrations and observe contractions.",
      "Record responses using a suitable recording system.",
      "Discard tissue and clean the bath thoroughly after use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Handle tissues gently to avoid damage.",
      "Maintain correct gas mixture and temperature.",
      "Avoid cross-contamination between different drug solutions.",
      "Train students in safe handling of biological materials.",
      "Dispose of biological waste according to biosafety guidelines."
