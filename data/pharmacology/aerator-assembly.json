    "purpose": "To maintain oxygen supply and circulation in isolated organ baths.",
    "scope": "Applicable to isolated tissue experiments in pharmacology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Connect the aerator pump to the power source.",
      "Attach tubing to each organ bath reservoir.",
      "Adjust the airflow control to produce fine bubbles in the bathing solution.",
      "Verify uniform aeration across all baths.",
      "Monitor the solution for pH and temperature stability.",
      "After experiments, disconnect and clean the tubing and airstones.",
      "Store the aerator dry and clean."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use sterile tubing and airstones to prevent contamination.",
      "Avoid excessive bubbling that disrupts tissue.",
      "Check for leaks or blockages in tubing.",
      "Do not run the pump dry for extended periods.",
      "Ensure backup power for critical experiments."
