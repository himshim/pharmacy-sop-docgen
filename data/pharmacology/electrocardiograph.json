    "purpose": "To record electrical activity of the heart in experimental animals.",
    "scope": "Applicable to cardiovascular pharmacology studies.",
    "procedure": [
      "Connect the ECG leads to the appropriate limb or chest positions.",
      "Ensure good electrode contact using conductive gel or clips.",
      "Select the desired lead configuration and paper speed or screen settings.",
      "Start recording before administering any test drug.",
      "Observe and record baseline ECG.",
      "Administer the drug and continuously monitor ECG changes.",
      "Save or print ECG tracings for analysis.",
      "Disconnect electrodes and clean the animal and equipment."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid electrical interference by proper grounding.",
      "Check cables and electrodes for damage.",
      "Use appropriate sedation or anesthesia to minimize movement artifacts.",
