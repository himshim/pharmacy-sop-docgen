    "purpose": "To simultaneously study multiple isolated tissues under identical or varying conditions.",
    "scope": "Applicable to comparative pharmacological studies.",
    "procedure": [
      "Fill each bath with physiological solution and maintain at controlled temperature.",
      "Aerate each bath appropriately.",
      "Mount tissues in each bath with corresponding transducers.",
      "Apply resting tension and allow equilibration with periodic washing.",
      "Administer drugs according to experimental design in selected baths.",
      "Record responses from all channels.",
      "At the end, discard tissues and clean all baths and tubing."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Ensure no cross-contamination between baths.",
      "Check uniformity of temperature and aeration across baths.",
      "Label each bath clearly.",
      "Avoid overloading the support frame.",
      "Inspect electrical connections and heaters regularly."
