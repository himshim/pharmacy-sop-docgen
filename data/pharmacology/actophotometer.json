    "purpose": "To quantify locomotor activity by counting infrared beam interruptions in a test chamber.",
    "scope": "Applicable to screening drugs for CNS stimulant or depressant effects.",
    "procedure": [
      "Turn ON the actophotometer and allow it to stabilize.",
      "Place the test animal in the chamber and close the lid.",
      "Set the test duration and start the device.",
      "After the test, record the digital count of beam breaks.",
      "Remove the animal and disinfect the chamber interior.",
      "Repeat for control and test groups maintaining the same conditions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Calibrate the instrument before use.",
      "Ensure animals are of the same strain, age, and weight.",
      "Test in a quiet, low-light environment.",
      "Clean the chamber between animals to avoid olfactory cues.",
      "Verify all IR beams are functioning properly."
