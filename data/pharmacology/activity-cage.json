    "purpose": "To measure spontaneous locomotor activity of experimental animals as an indicator of CNS effects.",
    "scope": "Applicable to behavioral pharmacology studies.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the animal in the activity cage and allow acclimatization for 10-15 minutes.",
      "Reset the counter and start the timer.",
      "Observe the animal for the predetermined test period (e.g., 5 or 10 minutes).",
      "Record the number of beam interruptions or cage crossings.",
      "Remove the animal and clean the cage with disinfectant.",
      "Calculate the activity score and document in the experimental record."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Handle animals gently to minimize stress.",
      "Ensure the cage is clean and free from odors before introducing animals.",
      "Perform tests at the same time each day for consistency.",
      "Avoid testing sick or injured animals.",
      "Clean the optical beams if they become dirty."
