    "purpose": "To evaluate conditioned avoidance response and learning using a pole-climbing paradigm.",
    "scope": "Applicable to screening of antipsychotic and nootropic agents.",
    "procedure": [
      "Place the animal in the chamber at the base of the pole.",
      "Present the conditioned stimulus (e.g., buzzer) followed by an unconditioned stimulus (mild foot shock).",
      "Allow the animal to climb the pole to avoid or escape the shock.",
      "Record latency to climb and number of avoidance responses over repeated trials.",
      "Continue training sessions as per protocol and perform test sessions without shock if required.",
      "Clean the apparatus after each session."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use humane shock intensities within ethical limits.",
      "Monitor animals for undue stress or fatigue.",
      "Ensure the pole provides adequate grip and is securely fixed.",
      "Standardize inter-trial intervals.",
      "Check electrical components and insulation regularly."
