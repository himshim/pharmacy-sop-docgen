    "purpose": "To deliver very small volumes of drugs at precise low flow rates.",
    "scope": "Applicable to micro-infusion studies in pharmacology.",
    "procedure": [
      "Mount a calibrated microsyringe into the pump holder.",
      "Set the desired infusion rate and total volume.",
      "Prime the system to remove air bubbles.",
      "Connect the syringe outlet to the micro-catheter or experimental setup.",
      "Start the pump and monitor operation.",
      "Stop infusion at the programmed end point or manually if needed.",
      "Remove and dispose of the syringe and tubing appropriately."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Verify syringe size setting to avoid dosing errors.",
      "Avoid air entry into the system.",
      "Use only compatible solvents and drugs with the syringe material.",
      "Regularly check for mechanical wear or drift in delivery rate.",
      "Calibrate periodically using gravimetric methods."
