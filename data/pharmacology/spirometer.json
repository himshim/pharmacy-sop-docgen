    "procedure": [
      "Calibrate the spirometer using a known volume syringe if applicable.",
      "Attach appropriate mouthpiece or animal connector.",
      "Instruct human subjects or position animals as per protocol.",
      "Record tidal volume, vital capacity, or other parameters during breathing maneuvers.",
      "Save or document spirometric readings for analysis.",
      "Clean and disinfect reusable parts after each use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Use disposable mouthpieces where possible.",
      "Avoid cross-infection by strict disinfection between subjects.",
      "Ensure air leaks are minimized for accurate readings.",
      "Follow safety and ethical rules for human subject testing.",
      "Do not use on subjects with contraindicated respiratory or cardiac conditions."
